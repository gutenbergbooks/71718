<h3>
  REMINISCENCES OF WORDSWORTH<br>
  AMONG THE PEASANTRY OF<br>
  WESTMORELAND.<br>
</h3>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Having grown up in the neighbourhood of
Alfred Tennyson's old home in Lincolnshire,
I had been struck with the swiftness with
which,
</p>

<p class="poem">
  As year by year the labourer tills<br>
  His wonted glebe, or lops the glades,<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
the memories of the poet of the Somersby
Wold had faded 'from off the circle of the
hills.'  I had been astonished to note how
little real interest was taken in him or his
fame, and how seldom his works were met
with in the houses of the rich or poor in the
very neighbourhood.
</p>

<p>
It was natural that, coming to reside in
the Lake country, I should endeavour to find
out what of Wordsworth's memory among the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P2"></a>2}</span>
men of the Dales still lingered on.&mdash;how far
he was still a moving presence among them,&mdash;how
far his works had made their way
into the cottages and farm-houses of the valleys.
</p>

<p>
But if a certain love of the humorous
induced me to enter into or follow up
conversations with the few still living among the
peasants who were in the habit of seeing
Wordsworth in the flesh, there was also a
genuine wish to endeavour to find out how
far the race of Westmoreland and
Cumberland farm-folk&mdash;the 'Matthews' and the
'Michaels' of the poet as described by him&mdash;were
real or fancy pictures, or how far the
characters of the dalesmen had been altered
in any remarkable manner by tourist influences
during the thirty-two years that have passed
since the aged poet was laid to rest.
</p>

<p>
For notwithstanding the fact that Mr. Ruskin,
writing in 1876, had said 'that the
Border peasantry (painted with absolute
fidelity by Scott and Wordsworth)' are, as
hitherto, a scarcely injured race,&mdash;that in his
fields at Coniston he had men who might
have fought with Henry V. at Agincourt
without being distinguished from any of his
knights,&mdash;that he could take his tradesmen's
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P3"></a>3}</span>
word for a thousand pounds, and need never
latch his garden gate, nor fear molestation in
wood or on moor, for his girl guests; the
more one went about seeking for such good
life and manners and simple piety as
Wordsworth knew and described in fell-side homes,
or such generous unselfishness and nobility
among the Dale farmers as would seem to
have been contemporaries of the poet, the
more one was a little saddened to find a
characteristic something faded away, and a certain
beauty vanished that the simple retirement
of old valley-days of fifty years ago gave to
the men amongst whom Wordsworth lived.
The strangers with their gifts of gold, their
vulgarity, and their requirements, have much
to answer for in the matter.  But it is true
that the decent exterior, the shrewd wit, and
the manly independence and natural knightliness
of the men of the soil is to a large
extent responsible for raising expectations
of nobility of life and morals, the expectation
of which would be justified by no other
peasant class in England, and which, by
raising an unfair standard for comparison,
ought to be prepared for some disappointment.
All said and done they are Nature's
gentlefolk still.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P4"></a>4}</span>
</p>

<p>
One's walks and talks with the few who
remember Wordsworth, or <i>Wudsworth</i> as they
always call him, have done little to find out
more than the impression that they as
outsiders formed of him, but it allowed one to
grasp by the hand a few of those natural
noblemen who by their presence still give
testimony to a time and a race of men and
women fast fading away, and in need already
of the immortality of lofty tradition that
Wordsworth has accorded them.
</p>

<p>
While these few of his still living peasant
contemporaries show us the sort of atmosphere
of severely simple life, hand-in-hand with a
'joy in wildest commonalty spread,' that
made some of Wordsworth's poems possible,
I think the facts that they seem to establish
of Wordsworth's seclusion, and the distance
he seems to have kept from them and their
cottage homes, not a little interesting.  For
they point to the suggestion that the poet
lived so separate and apart from them, so
seldom entered the 'huts where poor men
lie,' or mixed with the fell-side folk at their
sports and junketings, that he was enabled,
in his swift selection and appreciation of
the good and pure and true in their
surroundings, to forget, quite honestly perhaps,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P5"></a>5}</span>
the faults of the people among whom he lived.
</p>

<p>
Be that as it may, this paper aims at
establishing no new doctrine or view about
the man, but at simply putting on record
reminiscences still in the minds of some of
those who often saw him, knew his fancies
and his ways (as only servants know the
fancies and ways of their master), and spoke
with him sixty, fifty, or forty years ago.[<a id="chap01fn1text"></a><a href="#chap01fn1">1</a>]
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap01fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap01fn1text">1</a>] This paper was written in 1881 and was read at the
annual meeting of the Wordsworth Society in London in
1882&mdash;Robert Browning in the chair.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
These reminiscences may seem worthless
to many, just from the fact that they are the
words of outsiders.  They will seem to others
of interest for that very reason.  And this
much must be said, they are trustworthy
records from true mouths.  The native <i>love
of truth</i>, or perhaps better, the native <i>dislike
ever to hazard suggestion</i>, or to speak <i>without
book</i>, is guarantee for that.  To ask questions
in Westmoreland is the reverse of asking
them of Syrian fellaheen and Egyptian
dragomans.  The Cumberland mind is not inventive,
nor swift to anticipate the answer you wish,
and one is always brought up sharp with&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Nay, I wadnt say that nayther':
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P6"></a>6}</span>
</p>

<p>
'Nay, I'se not sartain aboot that':
</p>

<p>
'Might bea, but not to my knowledge
howivver:
</p>

<p>
'Its nea good my saaing I kna that, when
I doant, noo than,'&mdash;and so on.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Twenty summers had let the daisies
blossom round Wordsworth's grave, when, in
1870, I heard of and saw the old lady who
had once been in service at Rydal Mount,
and was now a lodging-house keeper at Grasmere.
She shall be called as first witness,
but what kind of practical and unimaginative
mind she had may be gathered from the
following anecdote.  My sister came in from
a late evening walk, and said, 'O
Mrs. D&mdash;&mdash;, have you seen the wonderful
sunset?'  The good lady turned sharply round,
and drawing herself to her full height, as if
mortally offended, answered, 'No, Miss
R&mdash;&mdash;, I'm a tidy cook, I know, and,
'they say,' a decentish body for a landlady,
and sic-like, but I nivver bodder nowt aboot
sunsets or them sort of things, they're nowt
ataw i' my line.'  Her reminiscence of
Wordsworth was as worthy of tradition as it
was explanatory, from her point of view, of the
method in which Wordsworth composed, and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P7"></a>7}</span>
was helped in his labours by his enthusiastic
sister.
</p>

<p>
'Well you kna,' were her words,
'Mr. Wordsworth went bumming and booing about,
and she, Miss Dorothy, kept close behint
him, and she picked up the bits as he let
'em fall, and tak 'em down, and put 'em
on paper for him.  And you med,' continued
the good dame, 'be very well sure as how
she didn't understand nor make sense out of
'em, and I doubt that he [Wordsworth] didn't
kna much aboot them either himself, but,
howivver, there's a gay lock o' fowk as wad,
I dar say.'
</p>

<p>
And here it will be well to put in a caution.
The vernacular of the Lake district must be
understood a little, or wrong impressions
would be got of the people's memory of the
bard.  'What was Mr. Wordsworth like in
personal appearance?' I once asked of an
old retainer, who still lives not far from Rydal
Mount.  'He was a ugly-faäced man, and
a mean liver,' was the answer.  And when
he continued, 'Ay, and he was a deal aboot
t' roads, ye kna,' one might have been
pardoned if one had concluded that the Lake
poet was a sort of wild man of the woods,
an ugly customer of desperate life, or
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P8"></a>8}</span>
highwayman of vagrant habit.  All that was really
meant when translated was, that he was a
man of marked features, and led a very simple
life in matters of food and raiment.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The next witness I shall call to speak of
the poet is none other than the lad whose wont
it was to serve the Rydal Mount kitchen with
meat, week in week out, in the poet's days.
A grey-haired man himself now, his chief
memory of Wordsworth is that of a tall man,
'rather a fineish man in build, with a bit of a
stoop, and a deal of grey hair upon his head.'
</p>

<p>
In some of the days of close analysis that
are coming upon us, poets will perhaps be
found to have depended for the particular
colour of their poems, or turns and cast of
thought, upon the kind of food&mdash;vegetable
or animal&mdash;that they mostly subsisted on.  It
will be well to chronicle the fact that
Wordsworth had an antipathy to veal, but was very
partial to legs&mdash;'lived on legs, you med
amost say.'  But as my friend added,
almost in the same breath, that the poet
was 'a great walker i' t' daäles,' he had
uttered unconsciously a double truth.
</p>

<p>
The next fact that remained clear and
distinct in the butcher's mind was, that
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P9"></a>9}</span>
whenever you met the poet he was sure to
be 'quite [pronounced white] plainly dressed.'
Sometimes in a round blue cloak; sometimes
wearing a big wideawake, or a bit of an
old boxer, but plainly dressed, almost 'poorly
dressed, ya mun saay, at the best o'
times.'  'But for aw that, he was quite an object
man,' he added, meaning that there was a
dignity that needed no dressing to set it off,
I suppose, in the poet's mien and manner.
It was interesting to hear, too, how different
Wordsworth had seemed in his grave silent
way of passing children without a word, from
'li'le Hartley Coleridge,' with his constant
salutation, uncertain gait, his head on one
side, his walking-stick suddenly shouldered,
and then his frantic little rushes along the road,
between the pauses of his thought.  'Many's
the time,' said my friend, 'that me and
my sister has run ourselves intil a lather to
git clear fra Hartley, for we allays thowt, ya
kna, when he started running he was efter
us.  But as fur Mister Wudsworth, he'd
pass you, same as if yan was nobbut a stean.
He niver cared for childer, however; yan
may be certain of that, for didn't I have to
pass him four times in t' week, up to the
door wi' meat?  And he niver oncst said
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P10"></a>10}</span>
owt.  Ye're well aware, if he'd been fond of
children he 'ud 'a spoke.'
</p>

<p>
But Mrs. Wordsworth had made her
impressions too on the youth's mind.  'As for
Mrs. Wudsworth, she was plainer in her
ways than he was.  The plainest wooman in
these parts,&mdash;for aw the warld the bettermer
part of an auld farm-body.'  He intended
nothing disrespectful by this simile, he only
wished to say she was simple in manner and
dress.  But if Mrs. Wordsworth's personal
appearance had impressed him, her powers of
housekeeping had impressed him more.  She
was very persevering, and 'terb'le particular
in her accounts, never allowed you an inch
in the butching-book.'  It did not raise
one's opinion of Lake country butcher morality
to find this a grievance, but the man as he
spoke seemed to think a little sorely of those
old-fashioned days, when mistresses, not cooks,
took supervision of the household economies.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
I bade my friend good-day, and the last
words I heard were, 'But Mr. Wudsworth
<i>was quite an object man, mind ye</i>.'
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
It is an easy transition from butcher-boy
to gardener's lad, and I will now detail a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P11"></a>11}</span>
conversation I had with one who, in this
latter capacity at Rydal Mount, saw the poet
daily for some years.
</p>

<p>
It was Easter Monday, and I knew that
the one-time gardener's lad at Rydal Mount
had grown into a vale-renowned keeper of a
vale-renowned beer-house.  I had doubts as
to calling on this particular day, for Easter
Monday and beer go much together in our
Lake country.  But I was half reassured by
a friend who said, 'Well, he gets drunk
three times a day, but taks t' air atween
whiles, and if you catch him airing he will
be verra civil, but it's a bad day to find him
sober, this.'  I explained that I wanted to talk
with him of old Wordsworthian days.  'Aw,
it's Wudsworth you're a gaan to see about?
If that's the game, you're reet enuff, for,
drunk or sober, he can crack away a deal
upon Mr. Wudsworth.  An' i'se not so varry
seuer but what he's best drunk a li'le bit.'  I
was reassured, and soon found myself sitting
on the stone ale-bench outside the public-house,
the best of friends with a man who
had been apparently grossly libelled&mdash;for he
was as sober as a judge&mdash;and whose eye
fairly twinkled as he spoke of the Rydal
garden days.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P12"></a>12}</span>
</p>

<p>
'You see, blessed barn, it's a lock o'
daäys sin', but I remember them daäys, for I
was put by my master to the Rydal Mount
as gardener-boy to keep me fra bad waays.
And I remember one John Wudsworth,
Mr. Wudsworth's nevi, parson he was, dead, like
eneuf, afore this.  Well, he was stayin' there
along o' his missus, first week as I was boy
there, and I was ter'ble curious, and was like
enough to hev bin drowned, for they had a
bath, filled regular o' nights, up above, ya kna,
with a sort of curtainment all round it.  And
blowed if I didn't watch butler fill it, and
then goa in and pull string, and down came
t' watter, and I was 'maazed as owt, and I
screamed, and Mr. John come and fun' me,
and saäved my life.  Eh, blessed barn, them
was daäys lang sen'.'
</p>

<p>
I asked whether Mr. Wordsworth was
much thought of.  He replied, 'Latterly,
but we thowt li'le eneuf on him.  He was
nowt to li'le Hartley.  Li'le Hartley was a
philosopher, you see; Wudsworth was a poet.
Ter'ble girt difference betwixt them two
wayses, ye kna.'  I asked whether he had ever
found that poems of Mr. Wordsworth were
read in the cottages, whether he had read
them himself.  'Well you see, blessed barn,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P13"></a>13}</span>
there's pomes and pomes, and Wudsworth's
was not for sec as us.  I never did see his
pomes&mdash;not as I can speak to in any man's
house in these parts, but,' he added, 'ye
kna there's bits in t' papers fra time to time
bearing his naame.'
</p>

<p>
This unpopularity of Wordsworth's poems
among the peasantry was strangely
corroborated that very same day by an old man
whom I met on the road, who said he had
often seen the poet, and had once been
present and heard him make a long speech,
and that was at the laying of the foundation
of the Boys' Schoolroom at Bowness, which
was built by one Mr. Bolton of Storrs Hall.
</p>

<p>
On that occasion Mr. 'Wudsworth talked
lang and weel eneuf,' and he remembered
that he 'had put a pome he had written
into a bottle wi' some coins in the hollow of
the foundation-stone.'
</p>

<p>
I asked him whether he had ever seen or
read any of the poet's works, and he
answered, 'Nay, not likely; for Wudsworth
wasn't a man as wreat on separate bits,
saäme as Hartley Coleridge, and was niver a
frequenter of public-houses, or owt of that
sort.'  But he added, 'He was a good
writer, he supposed, and he was a man folks
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P14"></a>14}</span>
thowt a deal on i' t' dale: he was sic
a weel-meaning, decent, quiet man.'
</p>

<p>
But to return to my host at the public.
Wordsworth, in his opinion, was not fond of
children, nor animals.  He would come round
the garden, but never 'say nowt.'  Sometimes,
but this was seldom, he would say,
'Oh! you're planting peas?' or, 'Where
are you setting onions?'  but only as a
master would ask a question of a servant.
He had, he said, never seen him out of
temper once, neither in the garden, nor when
he was along o' Miss Dorothy in her
invalid chair.  But, he added, 'What went
on i' t' hoose I can't speak till'; meaning
that as an outdoor servant he had no
sufficiently accurate knowledge of the in-door
life to warrant his speaking of it.
Wordsworth was not an early riser, had no
particular flower he was fondest of that he
could speak to; never was heard to sing or
whistle a tune in his life; there 'was noa two
words about that, though he bummed a
deal';&mdash;of this more presently.
</p>

<p>
'He was a plain man, plainly dressed, and
so was she, ya mun kna.  But eh, blessed
barn! he was fond o' his own childer, and
fond o' Dorothy, especially when she was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P15"></a>15}</span>
faculty strucken, poor thing; and as for his
wife, there was noa two words about their
being truly companionable; and Wudsworth
was a silent man wi'out a doubt, but he was
not aboon bein' tender and quite monstrable
[demonstrative] at times in his oan family.'
</p>

<p>
I asked about Mr. Wordsworth's powers of
observation.  Had he noticed in his garden
walks how he stooped down and took this or
that flower, or smelt this or that herb?  (I
have heard since that the poet's sense of smell
was limited.)  'Na, he wadna speak to that,
but Mr. Wudsworth was what you might call
a vara practical-eyed man, a man as seemed
to see aw that was stirrin'.'
</p>

<p>
Perhaps the most interesting bit of information
I obtained, before our pleasant chat
was at an end, was a description of the way
in which the poet composed on the grass
terrace at Rydal Mount.  'Eh! blessed barn,'
my informant continued, 'I think I can see
him at it now.  He was ter'ble thrang with
visitors and folks, you mun kna, at times, but
if he could git awa fra them for a spell,
he was out upon his gres walk; and then he
would set his head a bit forrad, and put his
hands behint his back.  And then he would
start a bumming, and it was bum, bum, bum,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P16"></a>16}</span>
stop; then bum, bum, bum reet down till
t'other end, and then he'd set down and git
a bit o' paper out and write a bit; and then
he git up, and bum, bum, bum, and goa on
bumming for long enough right down and
back agean.  I suppose, ya kna, the
bumming helped him out a bit.  However, his
lips was always goan' whoale time he was
upon the gres walk.  He was a kind mon,
there's no two words about that: if any one
was sick i' the plaace, he wad be off to see
til 'em.'
</p>

<p>
And so ended my Easter Monday talk with
the poet's quondam gardener's boy, the now
typical beerhouse-keeper, half pleased, half
proud, to remember his old master in such
service as he rendered him, in the days
when it was judged that to keep a boy out
of mischief and from bad company it was
advisable to get him a place at Rydal Mount.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
I must ask you next to take a seat with
me in a waller's cottage.  If tea and bread
and butter is offered, you had better take it
also, it is almost sure to be pressed upon
you, and it is of the best.  I will be interrogator,
only by way of introduction saying, that
our host is a splendid type of the real Westmoreland
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P17"></a>17}</span>
gentleman labourer, who was in his
days a wrestler too, and whose occupation at
the building of <i>Foxhow</i> and <i>Fiddler's Farm</i>
in the Rydal Valley, often allowed him to see
the poet in old times.
</p>

<p>
'Well, George, what sort o' a man in
personal appearance was Mr. Wordsworth?'
</p>

<p>
'He was what you might ca' a ugly man,&mdash;mak
of John Rigg much,&mdash;much about seame
height, 6 feet or 6 feet 2,&mdash;smaller, but deal
rougher in the face.'
</p>

<p>
I knew John Rigg by sight, and can fancy
from the pictures of the poet that the likeness
is striking in the brow and profile.
</p>

<p>
'But he was,' continued George, 'numbledy
in t' kneas, walked numbledy, ye kna, but that
might o' wussened wi' age.'  In George's mind
age accounted for most of the peculiarities he
had noticed in the poet, but George's memory
could go back fifty years, and he ought to
have remembered Wordsworth as hale and
hearty.  'He wozn't a man as said a deal to
common fwoak.  But he talked a deal to
hissen.  I often seead his lips a gaäin', and
he'd a deal o' mumblin' to hissel, and 'ud stop
short and be a lookin' down upo' the ground, as
if he was in a thinkin' waäy.  But that might
ha' growed on him wi' age, an' aw, ye kna.'
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P18"></a>18}</span>
</p>

<p>
How true, thought I, must have been the
poet's knowledge of himself.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And who is he with modest looks,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And clad in sober russet gown?<br>
  He murmurs by the running brooks,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A music sweeter than their own;<br>
  He is retired as noontide dew,<br>
  Or fountain in a noonday grove.<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
And indeed, in all the reminiscences I have
obtained among the peasantry, these lines
force themselves upon one as corroborated by
their evidence.
</p>

<p>
'He' [Mr. Wordsworth], continued George,
'was a deal upo' the road, would goa moast
days to L'Ambleside i' his cloak and umbrella,
and in later times fwoaks would stare and
gaum to see him pass, not that we thowt
much to him hereaboots, but they was
straängers, ye see.'
</p>

<p>
It is curious, though natural, perhaps, to
find a sort of disbelief among the natives in
the poet's greatness, owing somewhat to the
fact that it 'was straängers as set such store
by him.'  They distrust strangers still, almost
as much as they did in old Border-times.
</p>

<p>
But the secret of Wordsworth's unpopularity
with the dalesmen seems to have been
that he was shy and retired, and not
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P19"></a>19}</span>
one who mixed freely or talked much with them.
</p>

<p>
'We woz,' said George, 'noan of us very
fond on him; eh, dear! quite a different man
from li'le Hartley.  He wozn't a man as was
very compannable, ye kna.  He was fond o'
steanes and mortar, though,' he added.  'It
was in '48, year of revolution, one Frost, they
ca'd him rebellious (Monmouth), and a doment
in Ireland.  I mind we was at wuk at Fiddler's
Farm, and Muster Wudsworth 'ud come down
maist days, and he sed "it sud be ca'ed Model
Farm," and sa it was.'
</p>

<p>
Speaking of Foxhow, he said, 'He and the
Doctor [Dr. Arnold], you've mappen hard
tell o' t' Doctor,&mdash;well, he and the Doctor
was much i' yan anudder's company; and
Wudsworth was a girt un for chimleys, had
summut to saay in the makkin' of a deal of
'em hereaboot.  There was 'maist all the
chimleys Rydal way built efter his mind.
I can mind he and the Doctor had girt
argiments aboot the chimleys time we was
building Foxhow, and Wudsworth sed he
liked a bit o' colour in 'em.  And that the
chimley coigns sud be natural headed and
natural bedded, a lile bit red and a lile bit yallar.
For there is a bit of colour i' t' quarry stean
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P20"></a>20}</span>
up Easedale way.  And heed a girt fancy
an' aw for chimleys square up hauf way, and
round t'other.  And so we built 'em that
road.'  It was amusing to find that the house
chimney-stacks up Rydal way are in truth so
many breathing monuments of the bard.  The
man who with his face to the Continent passed
in that sunny pure July morn of 1803 over
Westminster Bridge, and noticed with joy the
smokeless air, rejoiced also to sit 'without
emotion, hope, or aim, by his half-kitchen
and half-parlour fire' at Town End, and
wherever he went seems to have noted with
an eye of love
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The smoke forth issuing whence and how it may,<br>
  Like wreaths of vapour without stain or blot.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
But if from the highland huts he had
observed how intermittently the blue smoke-curls
rose and fell, he was most pleased to
watch on a still day the tremulous upward
pillars of smoke that rose from the cottages
of his native dale.  In his <i>Guide to the Lakes</i>
(page 44) Wordsworth has said, 'The singular
beauty of the chimneys will not escape the
eye of the attentive traveller.  The low square
quadrangular form is often surmounted by a
tall cylinder, giving to the cottage chimney
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P21"></a>21}</span>
the most beautiful shape that is ever seen.
Nor will it be too fanciful or refined to remark
that there is a pleasing harmony between a
tall chimney of this circular form and the
living column of smoke ascending from it
through the still air.'
</p>

<p>
And my friend George's memory of
Mr. Wordsworth's dictum about the need of having
the chimney coign 'natural headed and
natural bedded, a lile bit red and a lile bit
yaller' is again found to be true to the life
from a passage in the same <i>Guide to the
Lakes</i> (p. 60), in which the poet, after stating
that the principle that ought to determine
the position, size, and architecture of a house
(viz., that it should be so constructed as to
admit of being incorporated into the scenery
of nature) should also determine its colour,
goes on to say 'that since the chief defect of
colour in the Lake country is an over-prevalence
of bluish-tint, to counteract this
the colour of houses should be of a warmer
tone than the native rock allows'; and adds,
'But where the cold blue tint of the rocks
is enriched by an iron tinge, the colours
cannot be too closely imitated, and will be
produced of itself by the stones hewn from
the adjoining quarry.'  How beautiful the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P22"></a>22}</span>
colouring of the Rydal quarry stone is, and
how dutifully the son of the poet carried out
his father's will in his recent rebuilding of
a family residence near Foxhow, may be
judged by all who glance at the cylindrical
chimneys, or look at the natural material that
forms the panels of the porch of the
'Stepping-stones' under Loughrigg.
</p>

<p>
I rose to go, but George detained me.
For he was proud to remember that upon
one occasion Mr. Wudsworth had keenly
watched him as he put forth his feats of
strength in the wrestling ring at Ambleside,
'in the chuchyard, day efter t' fair, forty or
fifty years sen,' and had passed a remark
upon him.  It was in the days 'when fowks
wrestled for nowt no mair than a bit o'
leather strap.'  And George had 'coomed
to pit,' as the saying is, and 'Efter comin
agaen ya man and throwin' him, and
anudder and throwin' him,' was last man
in against a noted wrestler, one Tom
Chapman.  He had agreed for one fall.
Mr. Wordsworth was 'leukin' on.'  George and
his antagonist 'com' together, and Chapman
fell.  'And I mind that I was mair pleased
wi' Mr. Wudsworth's word than wi' t' strap
(or belt), for fowks tell't me that he keepit
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P23"></a>23}</span>
saying, 'He must be a powerful young man
that.  He must be a strong young man.'
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
So ends our chat with honest George, the
waller.  We will next interview a man who
at one time, for more than eleven years, saw
Wordsworth almost daily.  This was in the
days that Hartley Coleridge lived at the Nab
Cottage, or, as our friend puts it (with a
touch of menagerie suggestion in it), 'i' t'
daays when <i>he kep' li'le Hartley</i> at t'
Nab,'&mdash;for our friend was Coleridge's landlord.
I had considerable difficulty here, as in almost
all my interviews with the good folk, of
keeping to the object or subject in hand.
For li'le Hartley's ghost was always coming
to the front.  'Naäy, naäy, I cannot say a
deal to that, but ye kna li'le Hartley would
do so-and-so.  Li'le Hartley was t' yan for
them.  If it had been Hartley, noo, I could
ha' tell't ye a deal.'  And so on.
</p>

<p>
But in this particular instance my difficulty
was trebled, for my friend evidently nursed
the idea that Wordsworth had got most of
'his potry out of Hartley,' and had in
return dealt very hardly with him, in the
matter of admonishment and advice, while
at the same time Mrs. Wordsworth, in her
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P24"></a>24}</span>
capacity of common-sense accountant, with
a strict dislike to wasteful expenditure or
indiscriminate charity, had left something of
bitter in his cup of Rydal Mount memories;
and the old man would gladly enough pass
over a Wordsworth leaflet for a folio page
of li'le Hartley.  But he too would be true
in his speech, and would speak as he
'kna'ed,' neither more nor less.  In his
judgment Mr. Wordsworth was a 'plainish-faaced
man, but a fine man, tall and lish
(active), and allus aboot t' roads.  He
wasn't a man o' many words, wad walk
by you times eneuf wi'out sayin' owt particler
when he was studyin'.  He was allus studyin'
and you med see his lips gaen as he went
aboot t' roads.  He did most of his study
upo' the roads.  I suppose,' he added, 'he
was a cliverish man, but he wasn't set much
on by nin on us.  He lent Hartley a deal o'
his beuks, it's sartain, but Hartley helped him
a deal, I understand, did t' best part o' his
poems for him, sae t' sayin' is.'
</p>

<p>
'He wad often come i' t' efterneun and
hev a talk at t' Nab, and would gang oot
wi' Hartley takkin' him by t' arm for long
eneuf.  And when Hartley was laid by at
t' last, Muster Wudsworth com doon ivery
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P25"></a>25}</span>
day to see him, and took communion wi'
him at t' last.'
</p>

<p>
'Then Mr. Wordsworth and Hartley
Coleridge were great friends?' I asked.
</p>

<p>
'Nay, nay, I doant think li'le Hartley ever
set much by him, newer was verra friendly,
I doubt.  Ye see, he [Mr. Wordsworth] was sae
hard upon him, sae verra hard upon him, gev
him sae much hard preaching aboot his ways.'
</p>

<p>
'Well, but Mrs. Wordsworth was kind
to Hartley?' I said.
</p>

<p>
'Mappen she was bit I nivver saw it.
She was' [and here the old man spoke
very deliberately, as if this was the firmest
conviction of his life]&mdash;'she was verra
onpleasant, vara on-pleasant indeed.  A
close-fisted woman, that's what she was.'  But
further inquiry elicited the reason of this
personal dislike to the poet's wife, and a
narrative of it will probably win a public
verdict for the lady of Rydal Mount, with
damages for libel against the man who so
faithfully kep' li'le Hartley at the Nab, and
so made his lodger's wrongs his own.
</p>

<p>
'Well, you see,' he continued gravely,
'I mind yance I went up to t' Mount
to exe for sattlement of account, for
Mrs. Wudsworth paid for Hartley's keep, time he
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P26"></a>26}</span>
lodged at t' Nab, and I had fifteen shillings
i' t' beuk agin Coleridge for moneys I'd
lent him different times.  And she was verra
awkard and on-pleasant, and wouldn't sattle,
ye kna, for she thowt that Hartley had been
drinkin' wi' it.  But,' he added, 'howiver,
I wrote to his mother, as lived in London,
and she wreat to me and tell't me I was to
lend a shilling or two as Hartley wanted it,
and efter that she sattled wi' me for his
lodgment hersel', but Mrs. Wudsworth was
verra on-pleasant.'
</p>

<p>
I was glad to change a subject that so
distressed him, and asked how the poet was
generally dressed, and of his habits.
'Wudsworth wore a Jem Crow, never seed him in
a boxer in my life,&mdash;a Jem Crow and an
auld blue cloak was his rig, and <i>as for his
habits, he had noan</i>, niver knew him with a
pot i' his hand, or a pipe i' his mouth.  But,'
continued he, 'he was a girt skater for a'
that'&mdash;(I didn't see the connection of
ideas&mdash;pipes and beer don't generally make for
good skating),&mdash;'noan better i' these
parts&mdash;could cut his own name upo' t' ice, could
Mr. Wudsworth.'
</p>

<p>
Before rising to go, I asked, 'Which roads
were the favourites of the poet?'
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P27"></a>27}</span>
</p>

<p>
'Well, well, he was ter'ble fond of going
along under Loughrigg and ower by t' Redbank,
but he was niver nowt of a mountaineer,
allus kep' aboot t' roads.'
</p>

<p>
This was a bit of news I had not expected,
but we will bear it in mind, and test its truth
in future conversations with the poet's peasant
contemporaries.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Our next talk shall be with one of the
most well-informed of the Westmoreland
builders, and I am indebted to Wordsworth's
love of skating for an introduction to him.
For making inquiries as to this pastime of
the poet, I had chanced to hear how that
Wordsworth had gone on one occasion to
figure a bit by himself upon the White Moss
Tarn.  How that a predecessor of my friend
the builder who lived near White Moss Tarn
had sent a boy to sweep the snow from
the ice for him, and how that when the
boy returned from his labour he had asked
him, 'Well, did Mr. Wudsworth gie ye
owt?' and how that the boy with a grin
of content from ear to ear had rejoined, 'Nay,
bit I seed him tummle, tho'!'
</p>

<p>
I determined to seek out the builder and
have the story first-hand, and was well repaid;
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P28"></a>28}</span>
for I heard something of the poet's gentle
ways that was better than the grotesquely
humorous answer of the boy who saw him
fall.
</p>

<p>
The poet's skate had caught on a stone
when he was in full swing, and he came with
a crash on to the ice that starred the tarn
and the lad, who had thought 'the tummle'
a fair exchange for no pay, had been impressed
with the quiet way in which Wordsworth
had borne his fall.  'He didn't swear nor
say nowt, but he just sot up and said, 'Eh
boy, that was a bad fall, wasn't it?'  And
now we are walking along briskly towards
Grisedale, with the recounter of the story:
'Kna Wudsworth!  I kent him weel,&mdash;why,
he larnt me and William Brown to skate.
He was a ter'ble girt skater, was Wudsworth
now; and he would put ya hand i' his
breast (he wore a frill shirt i' them daays),
and t'other hand i' his waistband, same as
shepherds dea to keep their hands warm,
and he would stand up straight and swaay
and swing away grandly.'
</p>

<p>
'Was he fond of any other pastime?' I asked.
</p>

<p>
'Naay, naay, he was ower feckless i' his
hands.  I nivver seed him at t' feasts, or wrestling,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P29"></a>29}</span>
he hadn't owt of Christopher Wilson
in him.  Nivver was on wheels in his life,
and wad rayther ha' been a tailor upon
horseback happen, but he was a gey good un
on t' ice, wonderful to see, could cut his
neame upon it, I've hard tell, but nivver
seed him do it.'
</p>

<p>
So that the rapture of the time when as
a boy on Esthwaite's frozen lake Wordsworth
had
</p>

<p>
My friend had known Wordsworth well,
and what was better, knew his poems too.
'Here is t' verra spot, you'll mappen hev
read it i' t' beuk, where Wudsworth saw
Barbara feeding her pet lamb.  She tell't

there at t' time.  Eh, she was a bonny
lass! they were a fine family a' t' lot o'
Lewthwaites.  She went lang sen and left,
but she tell't me t' spot wi' her ain
lips.'  As I peered through the hedge
upon the high-raised field at my right, I
remembered that Barbara Lewthwaite's lips
were for ever silent now, and recalled how
I had heard from the pastor of a far-away
parish that he had been asked by a very
refined-looking handsome woman, on her
deathbed, to read over to her and to her husband
the poem of <i>The Pet Lamb</i>, and how she
had said at the end, 'That was written
about me.  Mr. Wordsworth often spoke to
me, and patted my head when I was a child,'
and had added with a sigh, 'Eh, but he
was such a dear kind old man.'
</p>

<p>
We passed on in silence till we were near
'Boon beck,' and opposite Greenhead ghyll,
'That,' said my companion, 'is a cottage as we
used to ca' i' these parts t' Village Clock.  Yan,
I'se fergitten his neame, a shep, lived here,
and i' winter days fowks fra far eneuf round
wad say, "Is t' leet oot i' t' shep's cottage?"
then you may wind t' clock and cover t'
fire (for you kna matches was scarce and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P31"></a>31}</span>
coal to fetch i' them days); and of a morning
"Is t' leet i' t' winder? is t' shep stirrin'?
then ye maunt lig nea langer," we used to
saay.'  My friend did not know that this
too was in 't' beuk,' as he called it,&mdash;that
Wordsworth had described "the cottage
on a spot of rising ground,"
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And from its constant light so regular,<br>
  And so far seen, the House itself, by all<br>
  Who dwelt within the limits of the vale,<br>
  Both old and young, was named the Evening Star.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Onward we trudged, entered the pastures
leading; to the Grasmere Common that stretches
up to the Grisedale Pass, there sat, and had a
talk as follows, the Tongue Ghyll Beck
murmuring among the budding trees at our feet:
</p>

<p>
'Why, why, Wudsworth newer said much
to t' fowk, quite different fra lile Hartley,
as knawed t' inside o' t' cottages for miles
round, and was welcome i' them a'.  He
was distant, ye may saäy, verra distant.  He
wasn't made much count on "nayther i'
these parts," but efter a time fwoaks began
to tak his advice, ye kna, aboot trees, and
plantin', and cuttin', and buildin' chimleys,
and that mak o' things.  He hed his say at
t' maist o' t' houses i' these parts, and was
verra particler fond of round chimleys.'
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P32"></a>32}</span>
</p>

<p>
It was delicious this description of the path
to fame among his countrymen the poet had
taken, but my friend explained himself as he
went on:
</p>

<p>
'He was yan as keppit his head doon
and eyes upo' t' ground, and mumbling
to hissel; but why, why, he 'ud never
pass folks draining, or ditching, or walling
a cottage, but what he'd stop and say,
"Eh dear, but it's a pity to move that
stean, and doant ya think ya might leave
that tree?"[<a id="chap01fn2text"></a><a href="#chap01fn2">2</a>]  I mind there was a walling
chap just going to shoot a girt stean to bits
wi' powder i' t' grounds at Rydal, and he
came up and saaved it, and wreat summat
on it.'
</p>

<p>
'But what was his reason,' I asked, 'for
stopping the wallers or ditchers, or tree-cutters,
at their work?'
</p>

<p>
'Well, well, he couldn't bide to see t'
faäce o' things altered,[<a id="chap01fn2atext"></a><a href="#chap01fn2a">2</a>] ye kna.  It was
all along of him that Grasmere folks have
their Common open.  Ye may ga now reet
up to t' sky ower Guzedale, wi'out liggin' leg
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P33"></a>33}</span>
to t' fence, and all through him.  He said it
was a pity to enclose it and run walls over
it, and the quality backed him, and he won.
Fwoaks was angry eneuf, and wreat rhymes
aboot it; but why, why, it's a deal pleasanter
for them as walks up Grisedale, ye kna,
let alean reets o' foddering and goosage for
freemen i' Gersmer.'
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap01fn2"></a><a id="chap01fn2a"></a>
[<a href="#chap01fn2text">2</a>] Readers who may chance to have seen the letter Wordsworth
wrote to the local paper when he heard the news of the
first railway invasion of the Lake district, will notice how
accurately true this piece of testimony is.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
'But Mr. Wordsworth was a great critic
at trees.  I've seen him many a time lig o'
his back for long eneuf to see whedder a
branch or a tree sud gang or not.  I mind
weel I was building Kelbarrer for Miss S&mdash;&mdash;,
and she telt me I med get to kna Wudsworth's
'pinion.  Sea I went oop til him as he com i'
t' way, and he said, "Ay, ay, t' building wad
dea, and t' site wad, but it's verra bare, verra
bare."
</p>

<p>
'I mind anudder time I was building t' hoose
aboon Town End, wi' a lock of trees and
planting round, and he said to me, "Well,
well, you're fifty years in advance here": he
meant it was grawed up weel.
</p>

<p>
'And I mind yance upon a time at
Hunting Stile thereaway he coomed up.
"Now, Mr. Wudsworth, how will it goa?" I
said.  He answered me, "It'll dea; but where
are the trees?" and I said, "Oh, it's weel
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P34"></a>34}</span>
eneuf for trees, it nobbut wants its whiskers."  "How
so?" said he.  "Why, it's a young 'un,"
I said, "and we doant blame a young 'un for
not hevin' it's hair upo' its faace."  And he
laughed, and he said, "Very good, a very
good saying; very true, very true."  But he
was ter'ble jealous of new buildings.
</p>

<p>
'As for Mrs. Wudsworth, why, why, she
was a verra plain woman, plainest i' these
parts, and she was a manasher an' aw, and
kepp t' accounts.  For ye kna he nivver knew
aboot sec things, nayder what he had or
what he spent.'
</p>

<p>
As we rose to continue our climb, my
friend looked at the trees in the little
stream-bed below us, and said, 'In my days there
was a deal of wild fruit in these parts.  We
hed toffee feasts i' t' winter, and cherry feasts
i' t' summer,&mdash;gey big gedderings at t' cherry
feasts.'
</p>

<p>
'Did you ever see Wordsworth at one?'
</p>

<p>
'Nivver, he nobbut followed ya amusement:
that was skating, as I telt ye.'
</p>

<p>
'Had he any particular friends among the
shepherds?' I asked.
</p>

<p>
'Nay, nay, not as ever I kent or heard on;
but he wozn't a mountaineer, was maistly
doon below aboot t' road.'
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P35"></a>35}</span>
</p>

<p>
'But what was his favourite road?'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, roond by Gersmere and t' Red Bank
and heam again, wiowt ony doubt.  He wad
gang twice i' t' day roond by Mr. Barber's
there.  He was a girt walker roond there,
and a'most as girt a eater.  Why, why, he
wad git breakfast at heam, poddish or what
not, and then come wi' Miss Wudsworth
roond t' lake to Mr. Barber's, and fall in wi'
them, and then off and roond agean, and be
at Barber's at tea-time, and supper up agean
before gaen heam.  And as for her, why
Miss Wudsworth, she wad often come into t'
back kitchen and exe for a bit of oatcake and
butter.  She was fond of oatcake, and butter
till it, fit to steal it a'most.  Why, why, but
she was a ter'ble cliver woman, was that.
She did as much of his potry as he did, and
went completely off it at the latter end wi'
studying it, I suppose.  It's a verra straange thing,
noo, that studying didn't run on i' t' family.'
</p>

<p>
It was, I thought, a little hard to expect
that the poet should have handed on the
torch, or to speak with disrespect of his sons
because they only thought in prose.  But it
was evidence in my friend, at least, of a
profound belief in the genius of the Rydal poet
and tree-and-building critic of old days.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P36"></a>36}</span>
And it would have been a guess shrewdly
made that it was Wordsworth's brotherhood
with him, in the interests of his builder life,
and jealous care for architecture in the vales,
that had made the bond so strong and the
belief in the poet so great, and exclusive.
We descended into the valley, took tea
together at the Swan Inn, and chatted on:
now learning that Wordsworth was a regular
attendant at Grasmere Church, now that he
would often in church-time be like a dazed
man,&mdash;forget to stand up and sit down, turn
right round and stare vacantly at the
congregation.  'But I mind ya daay perticler,
when he and Hartley and I cam oot o' t'
church tagedder.  I said, "What did you think
of the sermon, Mr. Wudsworth?" and he
answered me, "Oh, it was verra good, and
verra plain"; and I said, "Saame here,
Mr. Wudsworth"; and li'le Hartley put his heëad
o' ya side, and squeaked out, "Oh, did ye
think it was good? well, well, I was in
purgatory the whole time."
</p>

<p>
The stars were overhead as we left all that
was left&mdash;and that was little enough&mdash;of our
cosy evening meal; and, bidding good-night,
I went home, with more Wordsworth memories
to keep me company.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P37"></a>37}</span>
</p>

<p>
It was by happy accident that I was enabled
to have a chat with one of the best types of
our half-farmer, half hotel-keeper, only a few
days before he left the Rydal neighbourhood
for good, after a sojourn of sixty-five years
therein.  We met at the house of a friend
where he had been to pay his last rent due,
and as I entered the room I was conscious
of a be-whiskied conversationally aromatic
air that boded well for a reet doon good
crack.
</p>

<p>
'Kna Wudsworth!  I sud kna him, if any
man sud, for as a lad I carried t' butter to t'
Mount, as a grawin' man I lived and worked
in seet on him, and I lig noo upon t' verra
bed-stocks as he and his missus ligged on
when they were first wed, and went to Town
End theereaway.'
</p>

<p>
'Now tell me,' said I, 'what was the
poet like in face and make?'
</p>

<p>
'Well in mak he was listyish.  I dar say
I cud gee him four inches, now I suddent
wonder but what I could, mysen.'  My
informant stood about six feet four, or four
and a half.  'He was much to leuk at like
his son William; he was a listy man was his
son, mind ye.  But for a' he was a sizeable
man, was t' fadder, he was plainish featured,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P38"></a>38}</span>
and was a man as hed nea pleasure in his
faace.  Quite different Wudsworth was fra
li'le Hartley.  Hartley allus hed a bit of
smile or a twinkle in his faace, but Wudsworth
was not loveable i' t' faace by nea means,
for o' he was sizeable man, mind ye.'
</p>

<p>
'But,' I interrupted, 'was he not much
like your friend John Rigg in face?'
</p>

<p>
'He med be t' seame mak, ye kna, much
aboot; but, John Rigg hes a bit pleasant in
his faace at wust o' times, and Wudsworth,
bless ye, never had noan.'
</p>

<p>
'Was he,' I said, 'a sociable man,
Mr. Wordsworth, in the earliest times you can
remember?'
</p>

<p>
'Wudsworth,' my kindly giant replied, 'for
a' he hed nea pride nor nowt, was a man
who was quite one to hissel, ye kna.  He
was not a man as fwoaks could crack wi',
nor not a man as could crack wi' fwoaks.
But thear was anudder thing as kep' fwoaks
off, he hed a terr'ble girt deep voice, and ye
med see his faace agaan for lang eneuf.
I've knoan folks, village lads and lasses,
coming ower by t' auld road aboon what runs
fra Gersmer to Rydal, flayt a'most to death
there by t' Wishing Gate to hear t' girt
voice a groanin' and mutterin' and thunderin'
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P39"></a>39}</span>
of a still evening.  And he hed a way of
standin' quite still by t' rock there in t'
path under Rydal, and fwoaks could hear
sounds like a wild beast coming fra t'
rocks, and childer were scared fit to be dead
a'most.'
</p>

<p>
'He was a great walker, I know,' I broke
in.  'Which were his favourite roads? and
was he generally on the hills, or did he keep
pretty much to the valleys?'
</p>

<p>
'He was a gey good walker, an' for a'
he hed latterly a pony and phaeton, I newer
yance seed him in a conveyance in t' whole
o' my time.  But he was niver a mountain
man.  He wad gae a deal by Pelter-bridge
and round by Red Bank, but he was maist
terr'ble fond o' under t' Nab, and by t' auld high
road to t' Swan Inn and back, and verra often
came as far as Dungeon Ghyll.  You've happen
heerd tell o' Dungeon Ghyll; it was a verra
favourite spot o' Wudsworth's, noo, was that,
and he yance med some potry aboot a lamb
as fell ower.  And I dar say it was true eneuf
a' but t' rhymes, and ye kna they war put in
to help it oot.'
</p>

<p>
For the life of me, as he spoke, I didn't
understand whether he meant that the rhymes
fished the lamb out of the Dungeon Ghyll pool,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P40"></a>40}</span>
or helped the poet out with his verses,
but I suppressed a smile and listened attentively.
</p>

<p>
'But for a' he was a distant man, they war
weel spoken on, mind ye, at the Mount,'
continued my voluble friend.  'They stood high,
and he was a man as paid his way and
settled verra reglar; not that his potry brought
him in much, a deal wasn't made up in beuks
till efter he was dead.  Ay, and they lived
weel.  Many's the time, when I was a lad, and
I went wid butter, I could ha' been weel
content to be let aloan for a bit i' t' pantry.
'Ticing things there, mind ye.  And they kep'
three sarvants.  I kent t' cook and t' housemaid
weel, and yan they called Dixon, smart lile
chap as iver was seen in these parts, but
ter'ble given over to cauld watter and
temperance&mdash;he woz.  Coomed out of a "union,"
but verra neat, and always a word for
onybody, and a verra quiet man, particlar quiet,
nivver up to nea mischief, and always sat at
heam wi' t' lasses a mending and sewing o'
evenings, ye kna.'
</p>

<p>
I didn't know, but guessed at once the sort
of simple stay-at-home ways and happy-family
style of quiet domestic service, known to the
circle of maidens, who, after their day's work,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P41"></a>41}</span>
sat with their needles and thread entertaining
the guileless Dixon.
</p>

<p>
'And what is your memory of Mrs. Wordsworth?'
</p>

<p>
'Well, every Jack mun have his Jen, as
t' saying is, and they was much of a mak.
She was a stiff little lady, nowt verra
pleasant in her countenance neyther.'  I soon
found out that the word unpleasant was being
used in a double sense, and was intended to
convey rather an over-seriousness of expression
perhaps than any disagreeable look or
ill-tempered face.  'Ye're weel awar','
continued the former hostel-keeper, 'that we
mun a' hev troubles, times is not a' alike wi'
t' best on us; we hev our worrits and our pets,
but efter yan on 'em, yan's countenance comes
agean, and Wudsworth's didn't, nor noan o'
t' family's, as I ivver seed.'
</p>

<p>
'Did you ever see Mr. Wordsworth out
walking&mdash;round Pelter-bridge way?'
</p>

<p>
'Ay, ay, scores and scores o' times.  But
he was a lonely man, fond o' goin' out wi'
his family, and saying nowt to noan of 'em.
When a man goes in a family way he keeps
together wi' 'em and chats a bit wi' 'em, but
many's a time I've seed him a takkin' his
family out in a string, and niver geein' the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P42"></a>42}</span>
deariest bit of notice to 'em; standin' by
hissel' and stoppin' behint agapin', wi' his jaws
warkin' the whoal time; but niver no cracking
wi' 'em, nor no pleasure in 'em,&mdash;a desolate-minded
man, ye kna.  Queer thing that, mun,
but it was his hobby, ye kna.  It was potry
as did it.  We all hev our hobbies&mdash;somes
for huntin', some cardin', some fishin', some
wrustlin'.  He never followed nowt nobbut a
bit o' skating, happen.  Eh, he was fond of
going on in danger times;&mdash;he was always
furst on t' Rydal howiver; but his hobby,
ye mun kna, was potry.  It was a queer thing,
but it would like eneuf cause him to be
desolate; and I'se often thowt that his brain
was that fu' of sic stuff, that he was forced
to be always at it whether or no, wet or fair,
mumbling to hissel' along t' roads.'
</p>

<p>
'Do you think,' I asked, 'that he had
any friends among the shepherds?'
</p>

<p>
'Naay, naay, he cared nowt about fwoak,
nor sheep, nor dogs (he hed a girt fine yan,
weighed nine stone, to guard t' hoose) not
nea mair than he did aboot t' claes he hed
on&mdash;his hobby was potry.'
</p>

<p>
'How did he generally dress?'
</p>

<p>
'Well, in my time them swallow-lappeted
yans was in vogue, but he kep' to all-round
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P43"></a>43}</span>
plain stuff, and I mind hed a cap wi' a neb
tull it.  He wore that maist days.'
</p>

<p>
'Did you ever read his poetry, or see any
books about it in the farm-houses?' I asked.
</p>

<p>
'Ay, ay, time or two.  But ya're weel
aware there's potry and potry.  There's potry
wi' a li'le bit pleasant in it, and potry sec as
a man can laugh at or t' childer understand,
and some as taks a deal o' mastery to mak'
oot what's said, and a deal of Wudsworth's
was this sort, ye kna.  You cud tell fra t'
man's faace his potry wad nivver hev nea
laugh in it.
</p>

<p>
'His potry was quite different wark frae
li'le Hartley.  Hartley wad gang runnin'
beside o' t' becks and mak his, and gang
in t' furst open deur and write what he hed
gittin' on t' paper.  But Wudsworth's potry was
real hard stuff, and bided a deal of makkin',
and he'd keep it in his head for lang eneuf.
Eh, but it's queer, mon, different ways fwoaks
hes of makkin' potry now.  Fowks gaes a
deal to see whar he's interred; but for my
part I'd walk twice distance ower t' Fells to
see whar Hartley lies.  Not bit what Mr. Wudsworth
didn't stand verra high, and was a
weel-spoken man eneuf, but quite yan to
hissel.  Well, well, good-day.'  And so we
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P44"></a>44}</span>
rose to go; he to his farm, I to my note-book.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
I pass over sundry interviews of minor
import, and will detail as accurately as I can
the result of several conversations with one
who as a boy lived as page, or butler's
assistant, at Rydal Mount, and now himself in
total eclipse (for he is blind) delights to
handle and show with pride the massy,
old-fashioned square glazed hand-lantern, that
lighted his master the poet on his favourite
evening walks.
</p>

<p>
We go through Ambleside to reach his
house, and call for a moment at the shop of
a man for whom on his wedding-day Hartley
Coleridge wrote the touching sonnet in which
he describes himself as
</p>

<p class="t3">
  Untimely old, irreverendly grey,<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
and he will tell us that Mr. Wordsworth was
not a man of very outgoing ways with folk,
a plain man, a very austere man, and one
who was ponderous in his speech.  That he
called very often at his shop, and would talk,
'but not about much,' just passing the day.
He will tell us that Mrs. Wordsworth was a
very plain-faced lady, but will add that, 'for
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P45"></a>45}</span>
aw that, Mr. Wordsworth and she were very
fond of one another.'
</p>

<p>
There is, as one would expect, a sort of
general feeling among the dalesmen that it
was rather a strange thing that two people
so austere and uncomely in mere line of
feature or figure should be so much in love,
and so gentle and considerate in their lives.
I say as we should expect, for the men of
Lakeland and the women of Lakeland are
notably comely, their features notably regular.
I do not myself know of a single instance of
a really ugly married woman among the
peasants that I have met with in Westmoreland.
But at the same time we must remember
that the word 'plain,' whether applied to
dress or feature, in Westmoreland, means for
the most part simple, homely, unpretending,
unassuming, and is often a term of honour
rather than dispraise.
</p>

<p>
We shall, perhaps, as we near the village
where our blind friend lives, meet with an old
man who will tell us that he helped to bear
both the poet and his wife to the grave, but
he will add that he was not 'over weel
acquent wi' 'em, though he knas the room
they both died in,' and that the time he
saw most of the poet was the occasion
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P46"></a>46}</span>
when he conducted Queen Adelaide 'to
see the Rydal Falls, and all about.'
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
We have got to the end of our walk, and
here, picking his way by means of his trusty
sounding-staff backwards and forwards in the
sunshine he feels, but cannot see, is the old
man, or rather old gentleman who in former
times 'took sarvice along of Mr. Wudsworth,'
and was 'so well pleased with his master
that he could verra weel hev ended his days
at t' Mount,' but found it was over quiet,
and, wanting to see the world beyond the
charmed circle of the hills, left a good place,
but not before he had formed his opinion of
both master and mistress, and obtained
indelible impressions of their several
personalities, and had conceived along with these
an affection for them which glows in his
words as he talks to us of them.
'Mr. Wudsworth was a plaain-feaced man, and a
mean liver.'  The description, as I hinted in
the preface, would have staggered a
philo-Wordsworthian unaccustomed to the native
dialect.  'But he was a good master and
kind man; and as for Mrs. Wudsworth, she
was a downright cliver woman, as kep'
accounts, and was a reg'lar manasher.  He
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P47"></a>47}</span>
never know'd, bless ye, what he hed, nor
what he was wuth, nor whether there was
owt to eat in t' house, nivver.'
</p>

<p>
'But you say,' I interposed, 'that he
didn't care much whether there was or was
not food in the house.'
</p>

<p>
'Nay, nay, Wudsworth was a man as was
fond of a good dinner at times, if you could
get him to it, that was t' job; not but what
he was a very temperate man i' all things,
vara, but they was all on 'em mean livers,
and in a plain way.  It was poddish for t'
breakfast, and a bit o' mutton to t' dinner,
and poddish at night, with a bit of cheese
happen to end up wi'.'
</p>

<p>
'You said it was hard to get him to his
meals: what did you mean?' I asked.
</p>

<p>
'Weel, weel, it was study as was his
delight: he was aw for study; and
Mrs. Wudsworth would say, "Ring the bell," but
he wouldn't stir, bless ye.  "Goa and see
what he's doing," she'd say, and we wad goa
up to study door and hear him a mumbling
and bumming through it.  "Dinner's ready,
sir," I'd ca' out, but he'd goa mumbling on
like a deaf man, ya see.  And sometimes
Mrs. Wudsworth 'ud say, "Goa and brek
a bottle, or let a dish fall just outside door
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P48"></a>48}</span>
in passage."  Eh dear, that maistly wad bring
him out, wad that.  It was nobbut that as
wad, howivver.  For ye kna he was a verra
careful man, and he couldn't do with
brekking t' china.'
</p>

<p>
'And was he continually at study in-doors,
or did he rise early, go out for a walk
before breakfast, and study, as I have heard,
mostly in the open air?' I asked.
</p>

<p>
My friend answered at once.  'He was
always at it, ye kna, but it was nowt but
what he liked, and not much desk-wark
except when he had a mind tul it.  Noa,
noa, he was quite a open-air man was
Wudsworth: studied a deal aboot t' roads.  He
wasn't particlar fond of gitten up early, but
did a deal of study efter breakfast, and a
deal efter tea.  Walked t' roads efter dark,
he wad, a deal, between his tea and supper,
and efter.  Not a verra conversable man, a
mumblin' and stoppin', and seein' nowt nor
neabody.'

<br>
DOROTHY WORDSWORTH.
</p>

<p>
'And what were his favourite roads?' I
asked, in an innocent way.
</p>

<p>
'Well, he was verra partial to ganging up
to Tarn Foot in Easedale, and was fondest
o' walking by Red Bank and round by
Barber's (the late Miss Agar's house), or else
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P49"></a>49}</span>
t'other way about and home by Clappersgate
and Brankers, under Loughrigg.  Never was
nowt of a mountaineer, and Miss Dorothy
'companied him.  Eh dear, many time I've
watched him coming round wi' t' lantern and
her efter a walk by night.  You've heard tell
of Miss Dorothy, happen.  Well, fwoaks
said she was cliverest mon of the two at his
job, and he allays went to her when he was
puzzelt.  Dorothy hed t' wits, tho' she went
wrang, ye kna.'
</p>

<p>
'Then,' said I, 'Mrs. Wordsworth did
not help the poet in writing his verses?'
</p>

<p>
'Naay, naay.  Why, she was a manasher,
niver a studier, but for a' that there's nea
doot he and she was truly companionable,
and they wer terr'ble fond o' yan anudder.
But Dorothy hed t' wits on 'em boath.'
</p>

<p>
'And he was very devoted to his children,'
I put in.
</p>

<p>
'Ay, ay, he was fond of children like
eneuf, but children was nivver verra fond o'
him.  Ye see he was a man 'o moods, nivver
nea certainty aboot him; and I'se not sea sure
he was fond of other fowk's bairns, but
he was verra fond o' his ain wi'out a doot.'
</p>

<p>
'And was he very popular among the
folk hereabouts?'
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P50"></a>50}</span>
</p>

<p>
'There's nea doot but what he was fond
of quality, and quality was very fond o' him,
but he niver exed fowk aboot their wark,
nor noticed t' flocks nor nowt: not but what
he was a kind man if fwoaks was sick and
taen badly.  But farming, nor beast, nor
sheep, nor fields wasn't in his way, he exed
nea questions about flocks or herds, and was
a distant man, not what you might call an
outward man by noa means.  And he was
verra close, verra close indeed, fra curious
men.  He'd gang t' other side o' t' road rather
than pass a man as exed questions a deal.'
</p>

<p>
It was a mercy, I thought to myself, that
no Wordsworth Society had invited me to
collect and write down the results of a
cross-question tour in those days.
</p>

<p>
'But surely,' I said, 'he had some
particular cottage or farm where he would
go and have a crack.'
</p>

<p>
'Naay, naay.  He would go times or two
to farm Dungeon Ghyll way, but he wasn't
a man for friends.  He had some, neah
doubt, in his walk of life; he was ter'ble
friends with the Doctor (Arnold) and Muster
Southey, and Wilson of Elleray and Hartley
Coleridge.  I'se seen him many a time takkin'
him out arm i' arm for a talking.  But he
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P51"></a>51}</span>
was specially friendly with Professor.  I mind
one time when we was driving, me and
Mrs. Wudsworth and Miss Wudsworth, to Kendal,
and Professor Wilson was superintending
making o' a bye road up by Elleray there,
and he was in his slippers.  Nowt wud do
but Wudsworth must git down and fall to
talkin', and we went on; but he didn't come,
and Mrs. Wudsworth said, 'Ye mun drive
on; he'll pick us up at Kendal: no knowing
what's got him now Professor is wi' 'im.'  Well,
well, she was right.  For after putting
up at Kendal, who should walk in but
Wudsworth and Professor wi'out any shoes
to his feet neather, for Wilson was in his
slippers, and 'ad walk'd hissel' to his stockin'
feet, and left his stockin' on t' road an aw'
far eneuf before they got to Kendal.'
</p>

<p>
'But it was strange,' I said again in a
suggestive way, 'that Mr. Wordsworth should
be so well "acquaint" with Professor Wilson,
for he was a great cock-fighting and wrestling
man, was he not, in his day?'
</p>

<p>
'Ay, ay, biggest hereaboot,' my old friend
replied.  'It's queer, but it was along o'
his study, ye kna.  Wudsworth was nivver
nea cock-fyhter nor wrestler, no gaming man
at all, and not a hunter, and as for fishing
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P52"></a>52}</span>
he hedn't a bit o' fish in him, hedn't
Wudsworth&mdash;not a bit of fish in him.'
</p>

<p>
'I have read in his books,' said I, 'things
that make me feel he was kind to dumb
animals.'
</p>

<p>
'Naay, naay,' my friend broke in, 'Wrudsworth
was nea dog fancier; and as for cats,
he couldn't abide them; and he didn't care for
sheep, or horses, a deal, but if he was fond
of owt, it was of t' <i>li'le ponies</i>.  He was
a man of fancies, ye kna.  It was a fancy of
his.  He was fond of li'le ponies, nivver
rode a horse in his life, nivver.'
</p>

<p>
'But he went over a deal of ground in
his time.  Was he always on his feet?' I said.
</p>

<p>
'He went ower a deal mair ground nor
ever he saw, for he went a deal by night,
but he was a man as took notice, ye kna,
nivver forgat what he saw, and he went slow.'
</p>

<p>
'But,' said I, 'how did he cover so
much ground; was he never on wheels?'
</p>

<p>
'Ay, ay, wheels, to be sure, he druv a'
times, ye kna, in t' cart.  He, and
Mrs. Wudsworth, and Dorothy and me, we went a
deal by cart Penrith way, and Borradale and
Keswick way, and Langdale way at times.'
</p>

<p>
'What sort of a cart?' I inquired.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P53"></a>53}</span>
</p>

<p>
'Dung cart, to be sure.  Just a dung cart,
wi' a seat-board in t' front, and bit of bracken
in t' bottom, comfortable as owt.  We cud
ga that way for days, and far eneuf.  Ye
kna in them days tubs wasn't known.
Low-wood was nobbut a cottage, and there was
never abuv six or seven ponies for hiring
at Ambleside.  Tubs we ca' t' covered
carriages, tubs wasn't known in these parts.
But happen there was a tub or two at
Kendal.'
</p>

<p>
'And you must have gone precious
slowly,' I said.
</p>

<p>
'Ay, ay, slow eneuf, but that was
Mr. Wudsworth's fancy, and he'd git in and
go along, and then he git down into t' road
and walk a bit, and mak a bit, and then he
git oop and hum a bit to himsel, and then
he'd stop and hev a leuk here and there for
a while.  He was a man as noticed a deal o'
steans and trees, verra particler aboot t' trees,
or a rock wi' ony character in it.  When they
cut down coppy woods in these parts they
maistly left a bit of t' coppy just behint
wall to hide it for him, he was a girt judge
in sic things, and noticed a deal.'
</p>

<p>
'And would he,' I asked, 'tell you as
you jogged along in the cart, which mountain
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P54"></a>54}</span>
he was fondest off, or bid you look at the
sunset?'
</p>

<p>
'Ay, ay, times he would say, "Now isn't
that beautiful?" and times he would hum on
to himself.  But he wasn't a man as would
give a judgment agean ony mountain.  I've
heard girt folks 'at com to t' Mount say,
"Now, Mr. Wudsworth, we want to see finest
mountain in t' country," and he would say,
"Ivery mountain is finest."  Ay, that's what
he would say.'
</p>

<p>
'But I have been told that his voice was
very deep,' I put in, in a happy-go-lucky
way.  'Had he a loud laugh now?'
</p>

<p>
'I don't mind he iver laughed in his
life, he'd smile times or two.  Ay, ay, his
voice was deep one; bit I mind at t'
family prayers in t' morning he'd read a bit
o' <i>the</i> Scripture to us, and he was a verra
articulate, particlar good reader, was
Mr. Wudsworth, always hed family prayer in the
morning, and went to church wi' prayer-book
under his arm, verra regular yance upon the
Sunday, he did.'  My friend added, 'He
was quite a serious-minded man, and a man
of moods.'
</p>

<p>
Here ended my talk with the old retainer
at the Mount.  But I was not allowed to go
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P55"></a>55}</span>
off until I had seen and handled the
old-fashioned candle lattern by which, as my
kind informant put it, the poet 'did a deal
of his study aboot t' roads efter dark.'
</p>

<p>
And so must end my plain unvarnished
tale.  I leave my indulgent readers to form
their own conclusions; merely suggesting that
the collected evidence points to a simple
plainness and homeliness of life such as remains
indelibly impressed upon the men of Westmoreland,
whose own lives are less simple in
these latter days, when ostentation and vulgar
pride of wealth in a class above them have
climbed the hills and possessed the valleys.
</p>

<p>
The testimony of the witnesses I have been
fortunate enough to bring before you seems
to agree in depicting Wordsworth as he
painted himself, a plain man, continually
murmuring his undersong as he passed along
by brook and woodland, pacing the ground
with unuplifted eye, but so retired, that even
the North country peasant, who does even
yet recognise the social differences of class
and caste that separate and divide 'the
unknown little from the unknowing great,' was
unable to feel at home with him.  'Not a
very companionable man at the best of times'
was their verdict.  But I think all the while
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P56"></a>56}</span>
these dalesmen seem to have felt that if the
poet was not of much count as a worldly-wise
farm or shepherd authority, nor very
convivial and free and easy as li'le Hartley
was, nor very athletic and hearty as
Professor Wilson, there was a something in the
severe-faced, simply habited man 'as said
nowt to neabody' that made him head and
shoulders above the people, and bade them
listen and remember when he spoke, if it was
only on the lopping of a tree or the building
of a chimney-stack.  'He was a man of a
very practical eye, and seemed to see
everything,' was the feeling.
</p>

<p>
And turning from the poet to his wife,
whilst one can see how the household need
of economy in early Town End days gave
her to the last the practical power of
household management that had almost passed
into a proverb, one can see also how true
was that picture of the
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Being breathing thoughtful breath,<br>
  * * * * *<br>
  A perfect woman, nobly planned,<br>
  To warn, to comfort, and command.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
'He never knawed, they say, what he
was wuth, nor what he hed i' t' house.'  She
did it all.  Then, too, it is touching to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P57"></a>57}</span>
notice how deep and true the constant love
between man and wife was seen to be, how
truly companions for life they were, and that,
too, in the eyes of a class of people who
never saw that
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Beauty born of murmuring sound<br>
  Had passed into her face,<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
and half marvelled that the spirit wed with
spirit was so marvellously closer than fleshly
bond to flesh.
</p>

<p>
Upright, the soul of honour, and for that
reason standing high with all; just to their
servants; well meaning and quiet in their
public life; full of affection in their simple
home life; so it seems the poet and his wife
lived and died.  Thought a deal of for the
fact that accounts were strictly met at the
tradesmen's shops, they were thought more
of because they were ever ready to hear the
cry of the suffering, and to enter the doors
of those ready to perish.
</p>

<p>
I do not think I have been able to tell
the world anything new about the poet or
his surroundings.  But the man 'who hedn't
a bit of fish in him, and was no mountaineer,'
seems to have been in the eyes of the people
always at his studies; 'and that because
he couldn't help it, because it was his hobby,'
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P58"></a>58}</span>
for sheer love, and not for money.  This
astonished the industrious money-loving folk,
who could not understand the doing work
for 'nowt,' and perhaps held the poet's
occupation in somewhat lighter esteem, just
because it did not bring in 'a deal o' brass
to the pocket.'  I think it is very interesting,
however, to notice how the woman part of
the Rydal Mount family seemed to the simple
neighbourhood to have the talent and mental
ability; and there must have been, both
about Dorothy Wordsworth and the poet's
daughter Dora, a quite remarkable power of
inspiring the minds of the poor with whom
they came in contact, with a belief in their
intellectual faculties and brightness and
cleverness.  If Hartley Coleridge was held by
some to be Wordsworth's helper, it was to
Dorothy he was supposed by all to turn if
'ivver he was puzzelt.'  The women had
'the wits, or best part of 'em,'&mdash;this was
proverbial among the peasantry, and, as having
been an article of rural faith, it has been
established out of the mouths of all the
witnesses it has been my lot to call.

<h3>
WITH THE BLACK-HEADED GULLS IN CUMBERLAND.
</h3>

<p>
There is no part of the Cumberland coast so
full of witchery and romance as the point where
Muncaster Fell comes down to the sea.  The
rivers of Irt, Mite and Esk, with their memories
of the pearl-fisheries of olden time, swirl down
toward the ancient harbour of the mythic 'King
Aveling's Town.'  One cannot look across the
pool at full tide without thought of how the
Vikings pushed their ships ashore here, when
they came from Mona's Isle to harry Cumberland.
</p>

<p>
But the sound of earlier civilisations is in our
ears as one gazes across the Ravenglass sand-dunes;
for here beside us is the great cavern of
ancient oaken-logs and earth, wherein the
Cymri buried their dead in prehistoric time,
and there within a stone's throw still upstands
the seaside residence of some great Roman
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P60"></a>60}</span>
general, who was determined apparently to
enjoy a well-heated house, and to do honour to
the <i>genius loci</i>.  No one who visits 'Walls'
Castle, as it is called, but must be struck with the
remains of the 'tepidarium,' and the little niche
that held the statue of the tutelary god, or a
bust of the presiding Cæsar, within the ample
hall.
</p>

<p>
Away at our back rises the Muncaster Fell
with its grey beacon-tower, its herd of deer, its
wind-blown oaks, its primrose and bluebell
haunted woods, that slope towards the Vale of
Esk.  Further inland, sheltered by its magnificent
wall of forestry, stands rose-red one of the
most interesting of our northern castles, with
its long terrace-lawn of quite unequalled grace
and loveliness.  There in sheltered combe the
rhododendrons bloom from earliest spring, and
the air will to-day be honeysweet from
laurel-flower far and wide.
</p>

<p>
But I was bent on seeing an older people
than Cymri, Roman, Viking, or Castle-Lord,
albeit the line of Pennington reached far into
the past, and suited well his ancient castle hold.
I had come in the last week of April, by
courteous invitation, to renew acquaintance with
that fast-growing colony of black-headed gulls
that make the dunes of Ravenglass famous.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P61"></a>61}</span>
</p>

<p>
A boat was called, and leaving the pebbly
beach that 'Stott of Oldham' so delights to
paint, we rowed across the flooding tide of the
Ravenglass harbour to the sand-dunes of happy
quietude, where the oyster-catchers were sunning
themselves, and where the sheldrake in her
nesting season loves to hide.  As one went forward
over the dunes one felt back in the great desert
of the Badiet-Tih, and expected to see Bedouins
start from the ground, and camels come in single
file with solemn sway round the sedge-tufted,
wind-blown hillocks and hummocks of glaring
sand.
</p>

<p>
Then suddenly the silence of the waste was
broken by a marvellous sound, and a huge cloud
of palpitating wings, that changed from black to
white and hovered and trembled against the
grey sea or the blue inland hills, swept by
over-head.  The black-headed gulls had heard of
our approach, and mightily disapproved of our
trespass upon their sand-blown solitude.
</p>

<p>
We sat down and the clamour died: the gulls
had settled.  Creeping warily to the crest of a
great billow of sand, we peeped beyond.  Below
us lay a natural amphitheatre of grey-green
grass that looked as if it were starred with white
flowers innumerable.  We showed our heads
and the flowers all took wing, and the air was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P62"></a>62}</span>
filled again with sound and intricate maze of
innumerable wings.
</p>

<p>
We approached, and walking with care found
the ground cup-marked with little baskets or
basket-bottoms roughly woven of tussock grass
or sea-bent.  Each casket contained from two
to three magnificent jewels.  These were the
eggs we had come so far to see.  There they
lay&mdash;deep brown blotched with purple, light
bronze marked with brown, pale green dashed
with umber, white shading into blue.  All
colours and all sizes; some as small as a
pigeon's, others as large as a bantam's.  Three
seemed to be the general complement.  In one
nest I found four.  The nests were so close to
one another that I counted twenty-six within a
radius of ten yards; and what struck one most
was the way in which, instead of seeking shelter,
the birds had evidently planned to nest on
every bit of rising ground from which swift
outlook over the gull-nursery could be obtained.
</p>

<p>
Who shall describe the uproar and anger
with which one was greeted as one stood in the
midst of the nests?  The black-headed gull
swept at one with open beak, and one found
oneself involuntarily shading one's face and
protecting one's eyes as the savage little
sooty-brown heads swooped round one's head.  But
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P63"></a>63}</span>
we were not the only foes they had had to
battle with.  The carrion crow had evidently
been an intruder and a thief; and many an egg
which was beginning to be hard set on, had
been prey to the black robber's beak.  One
was being robbed as I stood there in the midst
of the hubbub.
</p>

<p>
Away, for what seemed the best part of a
mile, the 'gullery' stretched to the north in the
direction of Seascale; and one felt that, thanks
to the public-spirited owner of the seaboard,
and the County Council of Cumberland, the
black-headed gull was not likely to diminish in
this generation.
</p>

<p>
Back to the boat we went with a feeling that
we owed large apologies to the whole sea-gull
race for giving this colony such alarm, and
causing such apparent disquietude of heart, and
large thanks to the lord of Muncaster for his
ceaseless care of the wild sea-people whom each
year he entertains upon his golden dunes.
</p>

<p>
That evening I went back in memory to the
marvellous sight in the Gullery at Ravenglass.
My thoughts took sonnet form as follows:
</p>

<p class="t3">
  THE HOPE OF LIFE.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Sudden the lilies of each lonely mound<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sprang into voice and palpitating wing;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I seemed a guilty and unwelcome thing;<br>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P64"></a>64}</span>
  Ten thousand shadows round me and around<br>
  Perplexed the air and danced along the ground;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each sooty head, in passion, dared to fling<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A world's defiance&mdash;and I felt the sting<br>
  And arrows of that deprecating sound.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Then gazing downward at my feet I saw<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silent cause of all these sorrowful cries,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;Large jewels, blotched and brown and green and blue,<br>
  In simple caskets wove from rushy straw;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thanked high Heaven for hearts so good and true,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shared their hope for life that never dies.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
They are a far-wandering nation these
black-headed gulls.  I had seen separate members
of the tribe on the banks of the Neva, and
later, on the banks of the Nile; for they are
an adventurous race, and may be found as
far north as Archangel and as far south as
Nubia, but the next time that I saw them in
any number they had changed not only their
appearance but their manners.  The black
or, more properly speaking, brown head of
the gull had become grey.  It seems they
only wear their black helmets or bonnets in
summer time.  Now it was winter, and
they were as mild as doves&mdash;tamer birds
could hardly be seen, and the history of their
taming, as indeed of their presence so far
inland as the Keswick valley, was very simple.
There had been a very cruel wholesale
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P65"></a>65}</span>
poisoning of the fish in the river Greta&mdash;the
black-headed gulls had heard of it, and came
up the Derwent in great numbers to the feast.
It cannot have been all pleasure, and to judge
by the looks of some of the greedier of the
class colic abounded.  Whether it was the
abundance of the feast or the after pain, that
made an impression on the gull, I know not,
but from that day to this the black-headed
gentry of the seaboard have had such affection
for our vale that any storm at sea or any
scarcity of food brings them in great numbers
to our valley pastures.
</p>

<p>
We had a hard winter three years ago,
and wherever the rooks were seen upon the
ground, the black flock was dappled with the
white sea gull, and the dolorous voice of
the crow was drowned in the laughter of the
black-headed gull.
</p>

<p>
Very grateful were we in those sad and
sombre winter mornings to hear the gulls
laughing round our house-roofs, and not the
least enjoyable thought as we went to our
breakfast-table was the knowledge that these
wild sea-people had come to trust us, and were
willing to be our almoners.
</p>

<p>
There was one house in the valley, set
upon a grassy hill overlooking the lake, which
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P66"></a>66}</span>
seemed especially to have charm for the bird
visitors.  Swift of ear, as of eye, the
black-headed gulls noticed that the family went to
breakfast at the sound of a gong.  No sooner
did that gong echo across the lawn, than the
heaven became white with wings&mdash;a click at
the gate was heard, and a maid with a large
pancheon of food specially prepared&mdash;hot and
tasty&mdash;was seen to come on to the grass and
toss out the meal, in splotches, round about
her.  Then what had been a silent grey
undulating cloud of wings broke up into a
tangled mass of down-sweeping pink legs
and up-sweeping white wings, and with the
noise of laughter and talk unimaginable, the
happy people fell to feeding.
</p>

<p>
I do not think that anything more dainty
can be imagined than that swift balance of
up-tilted wing and down-reaching rosy feet,
unless it be the consummate care and nicety
with which, before the black-headed gull put
beak to food, it tucked those long sweeping
slender wings close to its side.
</p>

<p>
Now and again as they fed, the whole
flock would rise momentarily into air and
float up as though blown from the earth by
some invisible breath, and then, as silently
and simultaneously, sink to earth again.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P67"></a>67}</span>
</p>

<p>
At times one noticed how, rising up, they
seemed to move in exactly one position,
moving their yellow rosy-stained beaks and
grey heads from right to left as though they
feared an enemy.  Yet they had no need to
fear, for it was quite clear that the rooks
had been specially engaged by them to be
their sentinels.  There they sat each in solitary
sable-hood, on the trees all round the
lawn,&mdash;policemen on guard, and of such good
manners, that until the visitors from the sea had
eaten and were full, they did not think of
claiming their share of the broken victual.
</p>

<p>
What astonished one most as these black-headed
gulls came morning after morning
to the sound of the gong, was their apparent
determination to lose no time about their
food.  They sat down to table and rose up
as one bird, but they were not more than
ten minutes about their meal, and there was
some reason for this.  There were other
breakfast tables spread for them on other
lawns; the gong at Derwent Hill was after
all but summons to a first course.
</p>

<p>
How mild, how gentle, with what dove-like
tenderness did these grey-headed people
of the sea appear as with merry laughter
they sailed about my head, their feet tucked
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P68"></a>68}</span>
up like coral pink jewels against their breast;
how unlike those fierce black-headed guardians
of their nests and young, who had dashed
at one, with open beak and scolding voice
and angry wing, upon the spring-tide dunes
of Ravenglass.

<h3>
AT THE GRASMERE PLAY.
</h3>

<p>
What a wonderful people these Westmoreland
folk are; we see them on the Wrestling Ground
at Pavement end, and we think we never saw
such 'playing.'  We enter a Westmoreland
dale farm, and we feel, if ever men and women
were born to make two ends meet by the care
of sheep or cattle, these are the people.  We
take lodgings in a Westmoreland village for
a holiday season, and though it may be quite
true that the landlady doesn't rave about the
scenery, and is rather of the type of the good
woman-body who had lived at Rydal Mount
before she became lodging-house keeper, and
who said to my friend, 'Yes, yes, I am a tidy
good cook and a decentish housekeeper, but I
don't know nowt about sunsets or sic like, and
I don't need, they've never been in my line,' it
is at the same time true that, for looking after
one's creature wants and entering into the doings
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P70"></a>70}</span>
of every day and making one feel part and
parcel of the household, a Westmorland
housekeeper is bad to beat.
</p>

<p>
But though I thought I knew the capacity
of Westmoreland folk pretty well, a new surprise
was in store for me as I took my seat in the
temporary play-house at Grasmere and learned
that Westmoreland folk can not only play in the
Grasmere wrestling ring, but can play on the
boards and before the footlights also.  It is
quite true that the Grasmere people have had
nearly a generation of training in the dramatic
art.  A late rector, who was much interested in
looking after the recreations of the village, had
translated for them many a simple pastoral play
from the French, and hardly a Christmas came
round, but he and his family, one of whom was
herself a talented writer of country plays, trained
the villagers to give their neighbours a play,
and the children in the Bands of Hope to act
charades.  Since his time another family who
are much honoured at Grasmere, and who have
the same kind of enthusiasm for the dramatic
capacity of the village, had carried on the work,
with the result that at a moment's notice, for any
simple play the daughter of the house might
write or adapt, she could count on having as
her players seventeen or eighteen of the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P71"></a>71}</span>
villagers who would seem born for the parts she
entrusted to them.  There was no rivalry, no
'fratching' from house to house because this
person or that person was not selected for this
or that particular part; on the contrary, the
village had such confidence in the conductor of
the village <i>troupe</i> that if Miss S. thought that
So-and-so was to take this part and So-and-so
the other, that was enough, and not another
word was to be said.  Meanwhile the village
had come to look upon the village play as part
of its very life and soul.  Grasmere in winter
time would not be recognised by the average
tourist.  It is a village of peace absolute and
tranquillity beyond words.
</p>

<p>
From the earliest times 'Cursmas' has been
looked upon as a time when everybody in the
dale should enjoy himself.  In the old days,
when the fiddlers went round from farm to
farm between Christmas-day and New Year's
Day, and when the Merry Night (or Murry
Neet) was held from place to place, the
Grasmere folk knew that, however hard they worked
for the rest of the year, at least they would
'laike' until the Twelfth Night, and precious
little work would go forward in the dales for the
first fortnight of each glad new year.  The
desire for some simple and rational form of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P72"></a>72}</span>
amusement with the beginning of every year
has never died out of their blood, so that a
village play seems to fill a need which is part
of their very nature.  'Why, we could not live
without it,' said a Grasmere body to me; 'it's
the brightest spot in our lives.'  'I can't tell you
how dramatic it makes me feel,' said another.
'I am going thro' my dialogue at all times
o' day.'  My husband said, 'You've had
company to-day then.'  'Ay, ay,' I replied, 'rare
company.  I was taking two or three parts in
second Act, you see, and changing voices,
that was all.'
</p>

<p>
'But where do you get your theatrical
properties?' I said.  'Who manages the
scene-shifting and all the rest of it?'  'Oh, as for
scene-shifting, that is all managed by that great
hairy-faced man that you saw going down the
road just now; he is a grand stage manager and
has been at it for twenty years or more.'  I did
not see him again until after the close of the
performance, when I noticed him with his
pocket-handkerchief in an unconventional way
fanning out the footlights, and then going up on
a ladder to puff out the oil lamps above the
stage.  'And as for properties,' the good dame
replied, 'if you mean by that the things we have
on the stage, well everything is lent&mdash;there is
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P73"></a>73}</span>
crockery from one house and chairs from
another, and the dresses, why they are the
old originals that were worn by our
grandmothers, and great-grandmothers.  We all
know to what farm or to what house we must
go for this or that particular dress, and it is
lent very willingly.'  'And do you have large
audiences?' I said.  'Large audiences, well, if
th' room would hold double the number we
could fill it, because folk of all maks and sizes
come together.  This year we are giving a
special afternoon performance for the quality,
but I am told that all reserved seats have been
booked for weeks.'
</p>

<p>
It was growing dark as I stood by the
cottage door.  The omnibus, as it drove
down from the Raise gap with folk from
Keswick coming to see the play, was sending
sparks out behind from its 'slipper,' as though
it were making fireworks.  And soon I saw
the lamp-lighter lighting up the oil lamps in
the quaintly intricate lanes of the village
beside the Mere.  Knots of people were
gathered already at their door-ways talking of
the play, and already folk were drawing
towards the village hall near the Red Lion.
I soon joined them, and passed up a break-neck
stairway to a big barn-like room, the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P74"></a>74}</span>
back part of which was filled with rough
boards knocked up into temporary benches,
and the forepart had wooden cottage chairs
for reserved seats.  The drop-scene was
down&mdash;the lake and island with Helm Crag and
Dunmail Raise, as seen from Loughrigg, on a summer evening.
</p>

<p>
A big moon shone in a solid sort of way
in mid-heaven, and was repeated at intervals
right down through the picture, as though the
scene-painters would say: 'This is the moon,
it is rising now, and there it is fully risen.'  But
I was assured that this was the result
of some accident by fire that had taken place
years ago in the said drop-scene, and that
these moons were, after all, only the patches
that repaired the beautiful picture.  Three
fiddlers and a piano were making lively music
when the bell tinkled and the curtain went
up.  It was a very simple scene&mdash;the village
carpenter sitting in his shop working away
at a stool, but it was to the life; and the
Jacob who was working there, with his red
handkerchief round his throat, spoke and
acted to the life, and well he might&mdash;he was
a village carpenter.  A tourist came upon the
scene, and got very little change out of Jacob,
and less still out of Jacob's mother, Mrs. Rawlinson,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P75"></a>75}</span>
who (after a very amusing dialogue
with the tourist) determined to allow him to
be her lodger.  She made him pay double
the usual price because he asked for 'sec a
new faddlement as a seven o'clock dinner.'  Dolly,
the maid, comes in with a handkerchief
bound over her head, as is the fashion
of the North-country maids when they are
dusting or brushing up.  They fall to talk:
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Rawlinson: 'I'se goin' to have mair
nor sebben shillings a room this time, but I
was forced to ask a good price, for he'll be
wanting late dinners, and a' maks o' cooking
and faddlements.  What does ta think
wawmlets'll be, Dolly?'
</p>

<p>
Dolly: 'Nay, I never heard tell o' sec a thing.'
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Rawlinson: 'And grilled bones to his
breakfast; but I kna' what them'll be, just a
marra bone served up hot in a napkin.  I
can mannish that finely.  Then he talked
about a dish o' curry; that'll certainly be
some mak o' a French stew, made rare and
hot wid pepper and an onion or two.'
</p>

<p>
Dolly: 'What, thou's goin' to be sadly tewed.'
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Rawlinson: 'Nay.  I was nobbut a
bit put about at first, but I mean to ask
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P76"></a>76}</span>
Betty Braithwaite to lend me her beuk as
larns yan to mak hundreds and hundreds of
things 'at I never heard of, nor naebody else,
I wud think.'
</p>

<p>
As long as I live I shall remember the
delightful get-up of this said Mrs. Rawlinson,
with her high black cap and flower in it, and
her old-fashioned criss-cross shawl, and her
spotless white 'brat'; and the way in which
she pronounced the word 'omelette' as
'waumlett' convulsed the house.
</p>

<p>
The second scene in that first act was one
that went home to the hearts of all, for if the
Westmoreland folk love one thing more dearly
than another it is 'a sale.'  The sale is really
the excitement of the winter time.  I believe
that if nobody was changing farms they
would compel someone in the neighbourhood
to pretend that he was, that a sale might be
held.  It is not the fierce excitement of
bidding one against the other that causes the
great gathering at the sale, but 'everybody's
tied to go,' as they say&mdash;bound to go to the
sale, just as everybody is bound to go when
they are bid to a funeral.  It would not be
friendly not to do so, and high, low, rich
and poor, one with another, meet at the sales,
as De Quincey has reminded us, to see
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P77"></a>77}</span>
one another and to hear how the world is
stirring.
</p>

<p>
The Grasmere Players in this sale scene
were all of the manner born, and a young
mason played the part of 'Tom Mashiter'
(auctioneer) with great delight to himself and
to his audience.
</p>

<p>
'Here's t' fadther and muther and t' dowter
he cried, as he put three teapots together.
2s. 6d. for the lot just to get us into the
bidding!  Here's a pair of copper scales; see
how true they hang!  Now I durst bet there's
not above half a dozen among us as honest
as them is.  There's not, howiver; and I
know who's yan o' the half-dozen; ye can
settle the other five amang you.  Three an'
six.  Three an nine.  Come, be quick.  Nay,
I'll not wait.  I'll tak some on ye in, ye'll
see, if ye don't bid quicker&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
And the scales were knocked down 'mid
roars of laughter.
</p>

<p>
'Here's another good jar, yan o' t' auld
fashion, wid a pair o' good lugs to hod by.
A penny for it I have bid; who'll say
tuppence?  Tuppence for you, Sarah.  It's a
real good un, yan o' t' rare auld-fashioned
mak, like me an you, Sarah.  I think there's
nobbut us two left o' the auld lang-eared breed.'
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P78"></a>78}</span>
</p>

<p>
Then there were quilts sold with a deal
of very amusing talk to make them go off.
One was in rags and tatters, but the auctioneer
suggested that it might do for a sick horse
or a sick cow.  I was listening with great
amusement, and I heard an old fellow beside
me say, 'Well, but things is goin' ower cheap,'
and in another moment jerked out, 'A
penny&mdash;here,' and was not a little astonished that
his bid was not taken.  I only mention this
to show you how to the life the whole thing
was done, and with what deep interest the
spectators gazed upon the play.
</p>

<p>
In the second act the plot thickens, and
the interest centres in the two chief actors
of the little play&mdash;Aaron Hartley, with his
apparently rejected addresses to the
statesman's daughter up at Hardcragg Farm, and
Betty Braithwaite.  Aaron comes into his
mother's kitchen, and, as far as any
Westmoreland man dare let himself go, allows her
to see that things are all up between himself
and Betty.  He must go off to 'Lunnon,'
for he cannot face living on in the dale now,
and all the hay grass but one meadow has
been got in.
</p>

<p>
'I think I must be going away, muther,
for a bit.  I don't see but that you'll mannish
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P79"></a>79}</span>
finely without me.  We've gitten a' the hay in
but t' midder, and that'll not take so lang.  It's
nobbut a light crop, and then it'll be verra
slack till bracken time, and what, Jonty's match
to make a good start with that if I sudn't be
back.'
</p>

<p>
Just then the farm servant Jonty enters.
I believe that he was a coachman in the village,
but he was a consummate actor, and his quaint,
silent ways and the lifting up of his hand and
scratching his head behind his ear when
talking were quite admirable.  He has had,
from youth up, the wish to have something
from London, and he tells Aaron that he's
'wonderin' whether he could mannish to bring
him a "spead" fra Lunnon' when he comes
back; 'but maybe the railway folk wad charge
ower dear for carryin' on it.'  Aaron chaffs
him out of the idea that a 'spead' made in
London is better than one made in Kendal,
and suggests a nice silk handkerchief.  'I
never thowt o' that,' says Jonty; 'that wad
be as like as aught.'  Libby, the pretty farm
servant breaks in here, and says: 'I wish tha
would think on it, and not be so ready with
thy jacket sleeve.'
</p>

<p>
'Ye'll not can tell me (says honest Jonty)
how much t' silk handkercher'll be until ye've
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P80"></a>80}</span>
bought it, I doubt; but if ye'll send word I
can just send ye the brass in a letter.'
</p>

<p>
And, saying, 'Well, I mun see all's reet
afore goin' to bed,' the faithful farm servant
leaves the cottage to go round the byre.
</p>

<p>
But the actress of the piece throughout is
Aaron's mother, Mrs. Hartley.  She sits
there at her knitting, with her pretty crossover
on her shoulders, sair troubled at heart by her
son Aaron's love affair; she drops her stitches,
for her eyes can hardly keep back the tears,
but she seems to know intuitively how much
and how little comfort she may give her son,
and how far she may insist upon his
confidences.  The attempt on her part to make
it appear as if it did not matter at all and
that everything will come right in the end
is very bravely done.  Fewest words are best.
</p>

<p>
'Good night, mother,' says Aaron.  'You'll
not mind a' I've said.'
</p>

<p>
'Nay, lad, not I.  Good night.'
</p>

<p>
And so the curtain falls.  The second scene in
the second act brings Jonty and Mattha Newby
(the village tailor) together.  Mattha, as I
heard, was the son of a village tailor.  To-day,
evidently from his boyhood's remembrances, he
is able to play the tailor's part well.  Jonty has
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P81"></a>81}</span>
been 'wrestling with a dyke' and torn his
jerkin, and Mattha volunteers to mend it.  A
song was introduced into this scene which
I had written for the occasion.  It ran as
follows:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Come! sweet April, whom all men praise,<br>
  Bring your daffodils up to the Raise,<br>
  Bid the delicate warbler trill,<br>
  Come with the cuckoo over the hill<br>
  Sprinkle the birch with sprays of green,<br>
  Purple the copses all between;<br>
  Bend the rainbow, and swell the brooks,<br>
  Fill the air with the sound of rooks,<br>
  Rubies lend, for the larch to wear,<br>
  The lambs are bleating, and May is near.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  August comes, and the speckled thrush<br>
  Sings no more in the lilac bush,<br>
  Lambs in the meadow cease to bleat,<br>
  The hills are dim with the noontide heat,<br>
  From all her hedges the rose is fled,<br>
  And only the harebell lifts her head;<br>
  But green are the new-mown vales with grass<br>
  As if the Spring were again to pass,<br>
  And children bring from the far-off fell<br>
  The rose-red heather&mdash;the bee loves well,<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Comes October with breath more cold,<br>
  She breathes, and the bracken turns to gold,<br>
  The cherry blushes as red as blood,<br>
  The rowan flames in the painted wood,<br>
  The larch-tree tresses are amber bright,<br>
  The birch is yellowing up on the height,<br>
  {82}<br>
  And over the valley and over the hill<br>
  A deep hush broods and the sheep are still,<br>
  But rainbow gossamers fill the air,<br>
  Tho' the old earth rests, the world is fair.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Now are the mountains winter-white,<br>
  Helvellyn shines in the clear moonlight;<br>
  The carollers sing, and the Christmas bells<br>
  Send sweet messages up the fells;<br>
  The old folk meet for their Christmas cheer,<br>
  The young folk skate on the frozen mere;<br>
  But Spring is coming, the shy buds peep,<br>
  The snow-drop moves in her long, long sleep,<br>
  The lemon-light shines on the leafless larch,<br>
  And the wood grows purple to welcome March.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Fair, how fair, are the changing days<br>
  That keep us happy beneath the Raise,<br>
  We who, in honour of Oswald the King,<br>
  Our 'bearings' still to the Old Church bring,<br>
  We who here in the silent time<br>
  Act our part and carol our rhyme.<br>
  Seasons change, and our hair grows grey,<br>
  But merrily goes the Grasmere play,<br>
  And two things stay with us all the year&mdash;<br>
  Love of our valley, and heart of cheer.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
It had been prettily set to music by a
Grasmere lady, and the two bass voices chimed in
with the two last lines in each verse, and Mattha
the tailor and Jonty the farm servant gave
great effect to the song by the sudden addition
of their manly notes.  Before the curtain falls on
this scene, we learn that the tourist (to whom
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P83"></a>83}</span>
we were introduced in the first scene),
Mr. Augustus Mallister, who has heard that she is
an heiress, is determined, if possible, to win the
heart of Betty Braithwaite.  He knows that
Aaron's absence has made her heart grow fonder.
He determines to write a letter, which shall be
posted in London, purporting to come from
Aaron, in which the absent lover declares that
he has become engaged to an American girl;
and so the curtain falls.
</p>

<p>
In the last act, and the first scene, there is a
pretty passage, although it is a pathetic one,
between Mrs. Hartley and the girl Betty Braithwaite,
to whom Mrs. Hartley has given Aaron's
letters to read&mdash;one of them the fatal letter.  In
the last scene Norman Braithwaite and his wife,
an excellent make-up, come in to talk matters
over, and the letter from London amongst other
things.  Jonty remembers how that, on a
certain day in August, the tourist chap, 'the
fine gentleman' as he called him, had been
spouting out a letter about an Aaron getting
wed to an American, and they at once seemed to
see light and to feel that the letter
Mrs. Hartley had received was a forgery.  Just at
that time Aaron and Betty enter, and one can
tell by a glance at them that it doesn't matter
how many forged letters have been written in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P84"></a>84}</span>
London; they have quite made up their minds
to make a match of it.  As for Mallister, 'the
fine gentleman,' Jonty breaks in:
</p>

<p>
'Is it Mallister you're talkin' on?  We weant
see any more o' yon ne'er-do-weel here.  I met
t' p'liceman going off wid him to Kendal.'
</p>

<p>
Norman: 'T' p'liceman!  What for?'
</p>

<p>
Jonty: 'It seems he's been wanted for some
time.  He's been up to some forgery or summat
o' that mak.'
</p>

<p>
Poor Mrs. Rawlinson, 'the fine gentleman's'
landlady, enters greatly distressed that the good
name of her house has been compromised by
letting lodgings to a forger.  'Why,' says
she, 'I thought he was a gentleman, wi' his
wawmlets to his breakfast, and his late dinners
and siclike.'  And so with the assertion that
there is nothing to wait for and the wedding
shall take place at Martinmas, the curtain goes
down, and all's well that ends well.
</p>

<p>
During the acting it was quite plain that the
actors themselves were as much interested as
those who witnessed the play.  'I was fairly
shamed of myself,' I heard one saying, 'to meet
with ye when I came off the last time, for the
tears on my face, but if you had given me a
five pound note I could not have helped
it.'  Ah, thought I, that was the secret of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P85"></a>85}</span>
your acting so well.  Now and again an
actor in undress would pass down the room
to have a look at the others as they performed
their parts, and to report.  They would come
back with much encouragement to their
fellow-players with such words as these: 'Eh, but
it's a grand company now, and walls is beginning
to stream now'; and in truth the heat of
the room and the consequent vapour bath was
a thing not to be easily forgotten.  But if it
had been twice as hot, and the hall had been
twice as crammed, and the play had been twice
as long, one could still have sat with real
pleasure to see such perfect acting done with
such simplicity and reality to the life.  One
wished that Will Shakspere could have come
along; how he would have blessed these village
folk for their truth and their simplicity.  And
how good a thing, thought I, it is, that there
should be a dull time at the English Lakes, so
that, without any temptations to extravagance
in scenery or setting of the plays&mdash;that would
inevitably come with a wider public,&mdash;these
natural dale-folk can delight their fellow-villagers,
by dramatic talent as real as it is remarkable.

<h3>
JAMES CROPPER OF ELLERGREEN.
</h3>

<p>
The pattern life of a public-spirited country
gentleman closed, when James Cropper of
Ellergreen, with eye undimmed and natural
force unabated, entered rest.
</p>

<p>
Come of an old Viking stock,&mdash;for his name
is found in the <i>Landnama Bok of Iceland</i>,&mdash;he
had inherited the best traditions of
true philanthropy from his grandfather,
who, with Zachary Macaulay, had worked
for the emancipation of the slave.  In him,
too, ran something of the spirit of good
old Quaker blood.  Whole-hearted Churchman
as he was, he loved as the Friends love,
simplicity in form and directness in religious
expression.  In earliest days he had cared for
social and industrial problems, and the sorrows
of the labouring poor entered into his heart.  It
was his good fortune to be able, by becoming
an employer of labour, in his paper mills at
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P87"></a>87}</span>
Burneside, to face these problems and to
become, as he always wished to become,
the father rather than the master of his
workmen.
</p>

<p>
He lived to see Burneside become, under his
fostering care, a model village.  He lived to
see some of his endeavours, notably his idea of
Co-operative Stores for the people, find
acceptance far and wide.  The guardianship of the
poor was a sacred trust to him.  As Chairman
of the Board of Guardians at Kendal for
twenty-five years, and as Vice-President of the
Northern Poor Law Congress, he both learned
and taught wisdom.  Almost the last thing he
talked with me about was a scheme for caring
for that most helpless class of our poorer
friends, the pauper imbeciles of Cumberland
and Westmoreland.
</p>

<p>
He was in early days a keen politician, and
represented his neighbouring town of Kendal
for five years in Parliament.  Latterly he had
felt that he could not be a partisan, or rather
that partisanship dulled sympathies, and though
it was a grief to him at the time to leave the
House at the redistribution of seats, he found
so much more of home politics to hand for him
to do, that he ceased to regret it.
</p>

<p>
When the County Council in Westmoreland
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P88"></a>88}</span>
met for its first time in 1888, they unanimously
elected James Cropper to be their chairman,
and to the day of his death his heart was in
the work.
</p>

<p>
The Queen Anne's Bounty Board gave him
the chance of helping the church of his love.
The late Bishop of Carlisle, Harvey Goodwin,
had no truer friend; and the present Bishop
Bardsley testified to the constant help to church
work in the diocese that this most earnest
layman was always willing to bestow.
</p>

<p>
But it was the cause of education&mdash;elementary,
secondary, public school, or university&mdash;that
was nearest to his heart.  As one of the
Governors of Sedbergh, and Heversham and
Kendal Grammar Schools, his counsel was
constantly sought.  As a believer in women's
education, he founded a scholarship at Lady
Margaret Hall, Oxford, and a bursary at the
Edinburgh Medical School for the training of
native Indian women as doctors.
</p>

<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-088.jpg" alt="JAMES CROPPER OF ELLERGREEN.">
<br>
JAMES CROPPER OF ELLERGREEN.
</p>

<p>
He was Chairman of a Kendal Education
Society which anticipated much of the present
endeavour of the Code to secure better instruction
for elementary teachers.  He was never so
happy as when he could gather the teachers on
the lawn at Ellergreen, and hold counsel with
them as to their future aims and their present
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P89"></a>89}</span>
progress.  The idea of a pupil-teachers' centre
at Kendal was his, and as Chairman of the
County Council he was able to lend it substantial
aid.  When the Voluntary School Association
came into being, he took up the idea warmly,
and personally visited every school within his
area, and made its wants and its difficulties
his own.
</p>

<p>
There was not a day that this public benefactor
did not do something to help his time.
And if one asked oneself why it was he had the
power to be a pillar of good in his generation,
a kind of beacon and standard for higher and
happier life in all classes of society round about
him, the answer seemed to be that he had a
heart which was for ever young, in a body that
seemed as if age could not touch it&mdash;that his
sympathies were not with the past, but with the
present and the future; that his enthusiasm for
the better time coming never failed him; that
he believed that all things work together for
good to them that fear God and keep His
commandments.
</p>

<p>
The grace of this abundant hopefulness
flowed out in all he did and said.  'Age could
not stale his infinite variety,' because he never
grew old.  To see him with young men or
little children was to see him at his best.  To
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P90"></a>90}</span>
know him in his home life was a privilege for
which to be thankful.
</p>

<p>
But deeper than all his spring of hope and
sympathy with the young and the new lay the
fountain of poetry at his heart.  He did not, I
think, write poetry, but the love of it was a
continual presence.  He had the poet's heart,
and entered into the poet's mind.  For him,
the practical public county magistrate and
councillor, the spirit of the innermost was the
joy of the imagination.  This was the secret
of his swift sympathy with nature and with man.
</p>

<p>
We met by appointment in the Tapestry
Room of the Spanish Palace at the Paris
Exhibition on October 12th, 1900.  He was
as cheery as ever.
</p>

<p>
'I have had a delightful week,' he said, 'I
wish all my friends could have seen this
wonderful exhibition.  Yesterday I was at
Chartres Cathedral.  I never knew what
stained glass was before; pray visit Chartres.
It is a revelation to one.'  Then he turned
to the Spanish tapestries and went with
deepest pleasure through the historic scenes
that the needles of the fourteenth and fifteenth
centuries have left on deathless record.  He
seemed as young-hearted as a boy, and as
fresh in his enthusiasm as if this Paris
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P91"></a>91}</span>
Exhibition was the first he had ever seen,
but he was seventy-seven and had seen more
than falls to most of us to see, of all this world
can show.  I did not know as I shook hands
and parted that Death already had shaken
him by the hand.
</p>

<p>
That night the sharp pain of pneumonia
was upon him.  I saw him once again, at the
bedside celebration of his last Holy
Communion, and then I saw him dead.  His
beautiful lace without a wrinkle in it with
all the look of youthfulness come back&mdash;but,
alas, without the bloom, beneath that ample
crown of snow-white hair which for years
past had added such dignity to his refined
and kindly presence.  As I gazed, the one
thought that came to me was this, did ever
man pass so little weary, so full of keen
interest and unabated enthusiasm after so
long a pilgrimage, right up to the doors of
that other world where, as we trust, all his
fullest powers shall find full play, or enter
these gates of life with so little pain?
</p>

<p>
He died in France and his body was borne
across the sea and laid to rest in the valley
he held most dear.  It seemed as if all
Westmoreland and Cumberland had come to
Burneside to do him honour at the homegoing.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P92"></a>92}</span>
</p>

<p>
The coffin, covered with wreaths, was laid
upon a simple wheeled bier in front of the
doors of Ellergreen, and so taken by hand
from the house to the church.  It was his
wish that no hearse should be used, and that
this simpler method of carrying the body to
its rest should be employed.  Before the
procession moved, many of those present
came up to the coffin to see the beautiful
photograph taken after death; and side by
side of it the picture of his bride taken on
her honeymoon.  Beneath these two pictures
were written the words from Christina
Rossetti's poem:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Think of our joy in Paradise<br>
  When we're together there,'<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
and beneath this a little note stating that
these were the words which he had begged
might be inscribed upon his tombstone.
</p>

<p>
Those who knew how ideal had been their
wedded life, knew also how through all the
long years of widowerhood and the grief of
separation that lent its pathos to his fine face,
there had been one sweet music to which he
moved&mdash;the music of the hope of a sure
reunion, that had surely come with joy at last.
</p>

<p>
The sunlight faded from the near fells, and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P93"></a>93}</span>
sorrow filled the air.  A single robin sang a
note or two and was silent, and the leaves
fell audibly to the ground.  But all who
gazed out east saw the blue Howgills and
the further Pennine range shine out like
burnished silver and gold, and thought of
the glory of that far land to which our
friend had gone.
</p>

<p>
The procession went up the drive and into
the lane, and so down into the village, where
every head seemed bowed and every home
a house of mourning.  The service, simple
throughout, included his favourite hymn:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Lord, it belongs not to my care<br>
  Whether I live or die,'<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
and at the grave side a third hymn was sung
which had been chosen by his daughter as
expressive of the continuity of happy life in
the world beyond.  The bishop pronounced
the benediction, the mourners placed their
wreaths at the grave side; silently the vast
crowd melted away, and left to its long rest
the body of one of the most public-spirited
servants of the common good that Westmoreland
has known.  He will be as sorely
missed as he will be surely mourned.

<h3>
A DAY WITH ROMAN AND NORSE.
</h3>

<p>
It was burning June.  The sun shone on
lake and fell.  Skiddaw was cloudless and
lifted into the clear heaven its purple lilac
shade powdered with the fresh fern and the
emerald green of the bilberry.  The corn-crake
cried in the valley, the throstle whistled
from the larch plantation; in and out of the
elder-blossom the tireless bees went humming,
and the haymakers could hardly get on with
their work for gazing at the exquisite beauty
of the wild roses on the hedge.  In Cumberland,
as Southey said, we miss the violet,
but we make up for our loss in April and
May by the blush roses of the June.  They
embroider the lanes, they dance upon the
hedgerows, they flash against the grey blue
waters of the lake, they flutter against the
green fellside.  Such roses! not faint in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P95"></a>95}</span>
colour and scent as we see in the South,
but red of heart and filled with fragrance,
wonderful wild roses of Cumberland.
</p>

<p>
What a day of life and loveliness it is!  On
the old Millbeck Hall door stone up yonder
are the words, 'Vivere mori, mori vivere,'
but we feel that the living, the living are
the hearts that praise, and death is, even by
suggestion, out of place here.
</p>

<p>
To-day as we dash along under Skiddaw
to see where Roman and Norseman once had
home, we feel that the same beauty was
beheld by earlier races, and the wild rose
that gladdens our sight was very dear to
eyes of far-off generations, and has been a
perpetual garden of life and loveliness for
all the passing years.
</p>

<p>
We are going to see the camps of the
warriors of old, and we do well to gather
and put in hat and buttonhole the emblem
of England's warrior saint, the good
St. George.  As one thinks of the flower, one's
mind does not only go back to Pisanello and
his picture of St. George away there in the
church of St. Anastasia in Verona, but to
the hundred shrines wherein are seen that
fair Madonna, the Rose of God, whose
painters honoured the wilding rose for her
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P96"></a>96}</span>
sake, and gave it immortality on their
canvases.  To Roman Catholic and to Protestant
alike, how significant and full of tender
association is the wild dog-rose of Cumberland!
How close it brings the church days of an
older time back to the present dwellers in
this country, seeing that both on Carlisle's
city arms and Carlisle's bishop's coat of arms,
the wild rose shines, memorial of the monastery
that honoured the Rose of Heaven.
</p>

<p>
But to-day we are going back to times
that antedate those mediaeval church days.
We are on visit bent to Roman and Viking
who dwelt in sight of Skiddaw&mdash;the cleft
one, in the days,
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'When never a wild-rose men would braid<br>
  To honour St. George and the Virgin Maid.'<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
We dash on by Dancing Gate, a farm beyond
Scalebeck, with its quaint holly trees,
whose sons have never forgotten the art of
dancing, on by Mirehouse with its memories
of James Spedding and Thomas Carlyle and
Alfred Tennyson, on under Ullock slope, and
by Ravenstone till we reach an old
farmhouse, quaint with its Jacobaean door-pilasters.
</p>

<p>
'For Orthwaite Hall and Overwater,' said
the coachman, 'we should turn off here to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P97"></a>97}</span>
the right and go up the Rake,' as he slackened
his paces.
</p>

<p>
There was an old Norse ring about that
word 'rake,' for the Icelanders still talk of their
sheep '<i>rachan</i>' just as our Cumberland shepherds
do; when the sheep follow one after
another along the mountain side, they are
hereabouts said to be 'raking,' but though
we were bent on a Norse chieftain's home
we refused to ascend the Rake.  It was very
hot and sultry, and we preferred the shady
woodland of Bassenthwaite 'parks,' and so
drove forward.  We passed the Vicarage
house and the Bassenthwaite Church, crossed
a small stream, and, turning sharply by a
deserted chapel towards the village, drove by
the village green, thence entering a kind
of meadow road, were soon in shadow, and
for more than a mile went, beneath bowery
oak, and fragrant larch, and gleaming hazel,
along this copse-lane sweet with wild woodruff
and gay with lychnis, towards the hillside
opposite the Dash, where stands Orthwaite
or Overthwaite Hall.  It is worth while
turning for a backward gaze as we ascend
the hill; Bassenthwaite and the fells that
close round far Derwentwater look nowhere
more beautiful than from here.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P98"></a>98}</span>
</p>

<p>
That little tarn on our left is not
Overwater, but it has its history; one hundred
sheep went on the ice one wintry day, broke
through, and all were drowned.  The current
superstition is that the pike in that tarn are
as large as donkeys; whether before or after
the feast of plenty accorded by the mountain
sheep is not told.
</p>

<p>
Here is Orthwaite or Allerthwaite Hall grim
and grey, its little Elizabethan window mouldings,
its diamond squares of glass, its quaint
low-ceilinged dining room.  There is a look
of drear sadness and of pale sorrow about the
quiet half-hall, half-farmstead, and there may
well be, for its owner William George Browne,
the traveller, went forth therefrom to explore
Tartary and Bokhara in the year 1812, and
being suspected by the Persian government
of sinister design, was, under instruction from
headquarters, taken captive beyond the Kizzil
Ozan river, blindfolded and barbarously
murdered.  Poor Browne! he had better have
stayed in sight of harmless Skiddaw, but his
was the gipsy's mind, and though none knew
quite why he journeyed, and his journeys in
Africa, Egypt, and Syria show that he travelled
more from love of wild roaming than for aught
else, home for William George Browne had
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P99"></a>99}</span>
no attraction in its sound.  His was the
restless wanderer's heart.
</p>

<p>
Now we leave the carriage, and while it
goes round to pick us up at Whitefield Cottage
on the Uldale and Ireby road, we descend
into the meadows and find ourselves gazing
on a large square entrenchment, at the angles
of which were once raised mounds, lying to the
south-west of Overwater.  No Roman camp
this, for Romans did not place their camps in
the bottoms, unless they had a secure look-out
above them, or a fortified camp on a height
near by; and Romans did not when they dug
an entrenchment round their camp, throw the
earth out to right and left and make an
embankment either side their fosse, as it is plain
was the case here; besides there is but one
entrance to the camp, and that was not the
Roman way.  No, the camp we are looking
upon was probably the kraal or stockaded
farmstead of a Norse chieftain, any time
between 874 and 950 A.D.
</p>

<p>
Its owner probably came up the Derwent
with Ketel, son of Orme, with Sweyn and
Honig or Hundhr, what time they harried
Cumberland under Ingolf or Thorolf the Dane.
For aught we know, he may have been tempted
hither by some sudden surprise-peep he got
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P100"></a>100}</span>
of the Overwater tarn and neighbouring
meadowland, from the heights of Skiddaw, the
first time he clomb that double-fronted hill.
</p>

<p>
It is true that a Roman tripod kettle is said to
have been discovered near, but the Romans were
not the only nation on the earth that worked
in bronze, and knew the advantage of putting
legs to their kettles; and both in the museum
of Copenhagen and Christiania such tripod
kettles may be seen to-day that came from
the hands of the Norsemen of old time.
</p>

<p>
As we gaze across the quiet meadow land
to the north-east, we see the high raised hill,
where it is more than probable that the Viking
chieftains, who here had their steading, 'died
into the ground,' as they expressed it, when
the death hour came.  At any rate that hill
is called Latrigg, which may well mean the
'Hlad Rigg' or 'Ridge of the Dead,' and as at
Keswick so here, the Vikings may have carried
up their dead chieftains for their last long
rest to yonder height.  It is by some thought
possible that the word Latrigg may come from
Norse words that signify the 'Lair Ridge,'
the ridge of the lair of wild beasts, and
doubtless in those early days the farmer who built
his stockade had cause to dread other wild
beasts than such as now trouble the hen roosts
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P101"></a>101}</span>
beneath Skiddaw.  Now on still nights the
shepherd of Underskiddaw may hear the fox
of Skiddaw calling across the waters of
Bassenthwaite to the red-coated vixen at Barf, and
hear her shrill bark answer to his cry, but
then the wolf howled and the wild boar
prowled, and there was need of stockade not
only against man but against the creatures
of the wild woodland.
</p>

<p>
We leave the meadow with its Viking
memories, walk on to join our carriage at
Whitefield Cottage, thence, driving along
towards Uldale and Ireby, see, far off, the
common of Ulph the Norseman that was often
waked by John Peel's 'horn in the morning,'
and, instead of descending into the valley that
separates us from that long moor that stretches
to Caldbeck, we turn sharply to the left, pass
a lonely house of some pretension, and drive
by a narrow lane through hedges covered with
wild-rose; away to the west, upon surmounting
the ridge, we suddenly come in sight of the
littoral plain&mdash;all peacock green and blue, the
Solway flashing in the distance&mdash;and the grey
hills of bonnie Scotland beyond.  We descend
the hill and pull up at a lodge gate.  "Snittle
Garth," says the driver.  The very name has
a Scandinavian ring about it; we enter the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P102"></a>102}</span>
Park and pull up at a pleasant-looking
country house.
</p>

<p>
By courtesy of the owner we pass in front
of the garden, gay with its flowers, and full
of the sense and sweetness of an English
country house.  We can hardly gaze at the
camp we have come to see, so fair and
beautiful is the vision outstretched before us
of Bassenthwaite laid in gleaming whiteness
beneath the dark hills of Wythop and the
purple vastness of Skiddaw, so exquisite the
shadowy foldings of the blue hills that take
the eye far up beyond the gates of Borrodale
to Gimmer Crag, to Great-End and far
Sea-fell.  But when we look at the camp we have
come to see we find ourselves standing on a
high plateau, sheltered on north and east and
west by rising ground.  The site of the camp
is rectangular, eighty-three feet by thirty-one;
isolated by a trench with regular scarp and
counter-scarp.  This trench is twelve feet broad
at the bottom, twenty feet at the top; the
scarp and counter-scarp are each nine feet, and
the depth is five feet.  The work, to all
appearance, is freshly done, and but for the fact that
no pottery has been revealed, might well be
work of Roman engineers.  As we wonder at
the quaint oblong island of green carved in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P103"></a>103}</span>
the hill side, surrounded by its dry moat, we
listen to what the sages say and archaeologists
guess about its origin and intent.
</p>

<p>
'The remains of a mediaeval pleasaunce,'
says one antiquarian.
</p>

<p>
'Not a bit of it,' says another, 'this was no
sheet of water for ornament, with an island in
its midst, this was a Roman sanitary camp.
Hither sick and sorry came the poor fellows,
whom the frosts of Cumberland had pinched,
or the dews of Cumberland had rheumatised,
or the malaria of the Derwent Vale had febrified,
or the swords and clubs of the stubborn
British had wounded, and here girt round by
friendly fence of water, sheltered from the
wind, uplifted in this quiet pastoral scene, they
built their rough wattle hospital, and prayed
to the goddess of health.'
</p>

<p>
'No, no,' says a third antiquarian, no
authority he, and therefore likeliest to be right.
'This was a battle holme.  Here in the olden
time men met for holm-gauge or wager of battle;
on that oval sward was decided, in the sight of
the assembled multitude, the feud of families or
the strife of tribes.'
</p>

<p>
We can, as we gaze, conjure up the whole
scene, and hear the crash of battle hammer, and
see the flame of the circling brand; but the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P104"></a>104}</span>
peace of the present subdues the passion of the
past, and the sound of the quiet grass-cropping
hard by of the unfearful sheep, the song of the
thrush from the neighbour sycamore recalls us
to such pastoral tranquillity as ill assorts with
the stormy drama
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Of old far-off unhappy things<br>
  And battles long ago.'<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Now rejoining our carriage let us drive west,
up hill, to the neighbouring Caermote.  We
shall feel all the time that the tribesmen,
gathered at their battle holme, can follow us
with their eyes, and wonder what on earth can
possess us to leave them with their fierce axe
play just going to begin, for the old deserted
look-out camp on the slope a mile away.  We
leave the carriage to descend the hill to the
south and await our arrival at the large square
double camp of the Romans on the lower slope,
and not without many pauses to wonder at fair
scene of the seaward plain, we make our way
up to the northern peak of Caermote Hill.
</p>

<p>
This, with its circular rampart, was probably
the 'mons exploratorius' of the large double
camp on the lower south-eastern slope, and a
glorious look-out the Roman legionaries must
have had, if on such a day of June they came
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P105"></a>105}</span>
with their wild roses in their hands to see the
sun come with its wild rose over Helvellyn, or
move slowly to its setting and turn the whole
grey Solway into gold.
</p>

<p>
Down now we go southward across the
pleasant green sward, negotiate one or two
rather awkward fences, and bearing a little to
the left, towards the main road that runs to
Bewaldeth, we soon find ourselves in the
midst of ramparts of the quaint double Roman
camp.  It is a camp within a camp, the larger
of the two being about 180 yards by 160 yards
square.  There is evidence that the cohort that
first encamped here must have felt that it was
a place of much strategic importance, for they
made the road from 'old Carlisle' to Keswick
run right through the middle of it.  The
continuation of this road, though it remains
untraced, probably ran along the east side of
Bassenthwaite up to the tiny Roman watch
camp at the 'Gale,' and so by Guardhouse
towards Penrith, and to Causeway Foot, on
the road to Ambleside.
</p>

<p>
They appear also to have felt that they were
in a dangerous country when first they rested
beneath Caermote, for they circled themselves
with a triple rampart and a double fosse.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P106"></a>106}</span>
</p>

<p>
But not for ever was there to be war at the
gates, even in Roman times.  The cohort gave
way to a 'century,' and the centurion, who
remained to keep the way from 'old Carlisle'
to Keswick open, was content to trust his safety
from attack to the guardianship of a single
ditch and rampart; and yet the fierceness of
fire and sword must in after times have been
felt again at this place.  Not many years ago
the ruins of some buildings near the north gate
of the large camp were discovered, that had
once been roofed with lead, but the buildings
had been set on fire, and the lead had poured
itself away into the ground.  There was nothing
to suggest that these buildings had been of
Roman workmanship, and though it is possible
that this was a kind of half-way store-house for
the lead miners of Caldbeck, who were sending
their mineral booty to the sea, it is quite as
probable that at some time or other a farmer
had here his 'strength' or 'strong house,' and
that 'rievers' from over the Border had made
short work of him, and given his farm-stead to the flames.
</p>

<p>
We leave the Romans of Caermote, and are
not surprised to think a sanatorium hard by
was necessary for the cohort of old time, if there
was as much water in the ground as there is
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P107"></a>107}</span>
to-day within and without the ramparts.
Thence we drive by way of Bewaldeth and the
inn by the Bassenthwaite cross-roads, to the
shores of what Southey called 'westernmost
Wythop.'  Hardly are we able to get forward,
for the cries of those who are with us in the
carriage to draw up, that we may gaze at this or
that wild-rose bush in all its tender fluttering
beauty.  But at last we win our goal&mdash;Castle
How Inn, near Peelwyke; then scrambling up
the hill we inspect the four trenches on the side
of the hill looking towards Peelwyke, whence of
old time gazed out the hardy Britons upon the
Roman camp fires blazing at Caermote.
</p>

<p>
As we gaze we think not only of Roman
times, but of the Viking times also; for down
below us lies the wyke or harbour where the
first Norsemen who ever came up Derwent
from the sea ran their boats ashore.
</p>

<p>
Who, or whence the Norse ancestor of John
Peel, who hewed the trees of the woodland
at our feet into planks and built his 'Pride of
the lake,' we cannot know, but he probably
had friends, Ketel and Ormr, and Sweyn, and
Honig and Walla, who would from time to time
come across the Crosthwaite Vale and step
aboard his galley, and sweep with flying sail or
gleaming oar along by the woods of Mirehouse
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P108"></a>108}</span>
or the shadowy cliffs of Barf to his 'steading'
here at Bassenthwaite; and it is more than
probable that he and his family 'died into the
ground' at Castle How, and there await the
glory of the gods and the coming of Odin.
</p>

<p>
We, as we gaze out south from the How of
the Viking, can see plainly to-day the burial
ground of other Viking chieftains of the dale on
the grey green Latrigg's height; and sadly
enough, we think, must they have passed into
the dark, if so fair a sun as this shone upon so
fair a scene, and the roses and elders were as
sweet for them as they are for us to-day.
</p>

<p>
On now through fragrant briar wood and
odorous larch to Keswick, and the ghosts of
Britain and Rome and Norway keep pace with
our hearts as we go.

<h3>
ARCTIC SPLENDOURS AT THE ENGLISH LAKES.
</h3>

<p>
The blizzard brought a greater gift of snow
to the hills of the English Lake District
than had been remembered since 1859.  The
storm left behind it a bewitching splendour,
and Skiddaw and Helvellyn and Glaramara
and Grassmoor never shone more fair.  Into
clear air above the Yorkshire fells the great
sun rose.  The heavens flushed above Helvellyn,
and presently the steep, angular cleft
on Grisedale was filled with blue shadow.
Then the light splintered upon Causey Pike
and Hindscarth, and Scafell shone like a
jewel of flame above the sea of deathly white.
Five minutes later the blank white snowfield
of Derwentwater was changed into a gleaming
floor of dazzling light, and all the
encircling hills seemed ivory washed with
gold.  A lilac veil of haze rose from the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P110"></a>110}</span>
Crosthwaite Valley and drifted up the snow
slopes, growing more gossamer-like as it
touched the ridges of the hills, and soon
the mountains stood as clear as at the dawn
against a cloudless sky.
</p>

<p>
Such blue of heaven touched the cones
of Skiddaw as one sees on a clear May
morning above the Oberland peaks, and one
wondered why it was that people who have
no chance of seeing Switzerland did not take
the opportunity of realising a Switzerland in
miniature when it was close beside their
doors.  One reads of excursions to the Palace
of Varieties at Manchester and Blackpool.
How comes it about that no excursions are
planned to such a world of varieties, such
ivory palaces of winter's garnishing and
nature's building, as, after heavy snowfall,
may be found in Cumberland?
</p>

<p>
The frost was still in the shade within 10
degrees of zero; on Chestnut Hill it had
been registered in the early morning as being
within 4 degrees.  People as they went about
the roads felt their feet almost ring upon the
snow, and children who tumbled into the
powder rose and shook the fine dust from
their hair and laughed to find they were as
dry as a bone.  The rooks above were silent
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P111"></a>111}</span>
and grave as they sat in solemn conclave
on the ash tree at the stable-end and waited
for such happy chances as the cook or
chicken-man might give them.  They were
frozen out.  Their tools were useless.  But
the tits were merry enough&mdash;blue tit, great
tit, and cole tit; how they clung and spun
and scooped at the cocoanuts and bones
upon their Christmas tree!  How the thrush
pecked at the suet; how the starling and
blackbird gobbled at the softened scraps upon
the ground; and how the chaffinch and the
robin partook of the crumbs that fell from
the rich bird's table, as those crumbs came
floating down from suet-lump or cocoanut above!
</p>

<p>
But we are off for a walk up to that old
burial ground of the Viking chieftains from
the land of the Frost Giants, which we still
call the Ridge of Death&mdash;Latrigg of to-day.
There, beside the path that leads from the
main road, is the golf ground, but golf has
been dispossessed by a fitter game for this
season, and down the long slide shoot the
tobogganers, and up the hill, with glowing
faces and in silver clouds of their own breath,
the happy people move.  As one gazes into
the valley another group of people in the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P112"></a>112}</span>
neighbouring hollow may be seen hard at
work with brush and curling stones, for the
Keswick folk are some of them devotees to
the rink, and the noise of the curlers fills the
air to-day.
</p>

<p>
We climb Latrigg, noting how the blizzard
has swept some of the snow from Skiddaw's
western flank, and let the long yellow grasses
and umber-coloured heather once more give
their beauty of pencilling to the otherwise
snow-white damask of their winter cloak.
Thence, after far sight of the snow upon the
Scotch hills sacred to the name of Cuthbert
and the memory of his mission in Strathclyde,
and near sight of the island hermitage,
like a black jewel in the snow-field of the
lake, which keeps the memory of St. Cuthbert's
friend Herebert safe in mind, we
descend to the vale.
</p>

<br>
ARCTIC SPLENDOURS AT THE LAKES.
</p>

<p>
As we descend we have a friendly crack
with a shepherd from the high fells, whose
dog has cleverly found and 'crowned' a
handful of the Herdwick sheep prisoned by
a snowdrift against a wall.  How did he
do this?  'Naay, I cannot tell tha, but I
suppose t' dog nosed 'em, ye kna; dogs
is wonderful keen scented.'  And had the
sheep taken hurt?  'Naay, naay; they were
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P113"></a>113}</span>
safe and warm as could be; they hedn't
even begun to woo' yan anudder.'  Wool
one another, what's that?  'Oh, sheep, poor
things, when they git snowbound and hev
nowt to eat, teks to eatin' woo' off t' backs,
to prevent pinin', ye kna.'  So saying, the
shepherd goes off, to quest for more, up to
the land of loneliness and wintry wild, and I
go down into the cheery vale.
</p>

<p>
How blue the snow is; you might have
supposed the fields out 'Wythop' way had
been washed with ultramarine; but one's eyes
are caught back by the beauty of the
snowdrifts by the roadside.  These snowdrifts
are for all the world as if great waves of
milk had curled over to breaking, and at
the moment had been fixed or changed into
crystalline marble.  And now the sun is
gathering its glory back into itself, and hangs
a globe of flame above 'Whinlatter' Pass.
Suddenly the light goes out from all the
valley meadows.  The day star has sunk
behind the hills.  But still old Skiddaw
flashes back the flame, and shepherds, out
Newlands way, can see the bastions of
Blencathra glow like molten gold.
</p>

<p>
For us, as we gaze out south, the range
of Helvellyn is the miracle of beauty that
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P114"></a>114}</span>
holds our eyes.  Far off and ghostly for the
haze, it lies upon a background of rosy flushing
afterglow, and seems to faint into a kind
of impalpable phantom of its former
strength&mdash;becomes no longer solid mountain, but
spectral cloud.  A light wind blows, and the
oak leaves in the hedge tinkle like iron;
the farmer calls the horse to get his hay, the
wren chirrups or scolds from the wayside
bank, and a partridge cries from the near
field.  Then all is silent and hushed for the
coming of the queen.  Over the dark pines
upon Skiddaw, and above the silver shoulder
of the hill, clear-faced and full, the February
moon swims up to rule the night.  And such
a reign of splendour was then begun as I
have no words to chronicle.  For the heaven
above Helvellyn was rosy pink, melting into
blue, and the sky above Skiddaw was, or
seemed to be, steel azure, and the west beyond
the Wythop range was gleaming amber.
There, in the midst of that golden sea, shone
Venus like a point of silver fire.  Sirius rose
and scintillated above Helvellyn's ridge,
Jupiter looked clear from near the zenith,
and Orion girt his starry sword about him in
mid-heaven; but it was the Moon who was
the queen of all our hearts.  It was she who
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P115"></a>115}</span>
laid her mystery upon the lakes, the hills, the
valleys, white with snow; she who made one
feel that if sunrise and sunsetting had been
fair to-day, the moon-rising in a land of
Arctic splendour had been fairer still.

<h3>
WILLIAM PEARSON OF BORDERSIDE.
</h3>

<p>
It is a pleasant thing for a Cumberland
Crosthwaite man to have to speak of a man
of the Westmoreland Crosthwaite.  It is a
special pleasure when one realises how
Cumberland helped Westmoreland to give us the
gentle mind and life of enthusiasm for Truth
and Nature which closed here at Borderside,
with 'unbroken trust in God,' and 'in hope
of immortal life,' on the 16th December, 1856.
</p>

<p>
I have read no life that seems to have
been so genuinely the fruit of enthusiasm
for the poet Wordsworth as was the life of
William Pearson.  He was ten years the
junior of the poet, and survived him six
years.  We may nevertheless look upon him
as a contemporary.  He was of the same
kind of North yeoman stock, and with greater
opportunities might have made himself a name
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P117"></a>117}</span>
in the annals of literature.  As it is, like
Elihu Robinson of Egglesfield, like Wilkinson
of Yanwath, like the late Wilson Robinson
of Winfell, Lorton, Pearson's name was
not known far beyond his native valley, but
of him, as of the others named, it is truth to
say that he was a living monument of what
'the soul of Nature,' if it be received into
the heart of man, can do to elevate, to
strengthen and refine.  Of none other in
his simple estatesman rank that I have read
of can it be more truly said, that from:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  '... Nature and her overflowing soul<br>
  He had received so much, that all his thoughts<br>
  Were steeped in feeling.'<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Wordsworth once wrote that 'Nature never
did betray the heart that loved her'; William
Pearson proved by all he said and did that
Wordsworth spoke the truth.  Wordsworth
spoke felicitously of the
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Harvest of a quiet eye<br>
  That sleeps and broods on its own heart.'<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
William Pearson gathered that harvest to
the full, ere he too, like a shock of corn, was
in a full time garnered.  Wordsworth declared
that
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Who feels contempt for any living thing<br>
  Hath faculties that he hath never used,'<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P118"></a>118}</span>
and William Pearson put that assertion to
good proof.  Few men in his day and station
in this country went down to the grave with
larger heart, of wider sympathy and more
love for all created things.
</p>

<p>
William Pearson was born at the Yews in
the Winster Vale on the 9th of October, 1780.
His father, who died at the age of 81 in the
year 1840, was long remembered as a quiet,
studious farmer, who would ever read a book
at his meals, and made a practice of going
afield at nights to gaze upon the heavens.
The stars in their courses helped him to
reverence and to thought.  William's mother&mdash;a
Little from the Borderland&mdash;survived her
husband and died at the age of 88 in 1842.
While she span at her flax-wheel she used
to delight her little son William with
folklore stories and fairy tales, but she was
chiefly remembered in the village for her
bright activity and energy to the last.  Many
a time, when she was between seventy and
eighty years old, on market day morning,
though the horse stood saddled at the door,
the old lady would say, 'Nay, hang it, I'll
never fash wid it,' and would set off on foot
to Kendal, with her butter basket containing
twenty to thirty pounds of butter, a distance
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P119"></a>119}</span>
of six miles and a half, and after 'standing
the market' and shopping, would walk home
again with her purchases.
</p>

<p>
As a youngster, William's education was
left to the wild beauty of his native vale.  If
ever there was a boy of whom Nature might
have said:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Myself will to my darling be<br>
  Both law and impulse: and with me<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <i>Boy</i>, in rock and plain,<br>
  In earth and heaven, in glade and bower<br>
  Shall feel an overseeing power<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To kindle or restrain,'<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
it was the boy who went afield with his
father as soon as he could toddle, and who
in Nature's kindly school got to know by
heart and eye the hills and scars of the
neighbourhood, the tarns and moorlands, the
trotting brooks, the rivers running to the sea,
the great estuary and marsh, with all their
bird and beast and flower life.  He never
forgot his first sight of Windermere and
Morecambe Bay, nor his first journey up
Troutbeck over the Kirkstone Pass; and no
sooner had he left home for work elsewhere
than he felt that there was only one place
on this earth where life was worth living and
that was the Winster Vale.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P120"></a>120}</span>
</p>

<p>
It is true that he went to the Crosthwaite
school and proved himself early to be a
master of figures.  The author who fascinated
him then was Defoe.  <i>The Memoirs of a
Cavalier</i> and <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> were his
teachers.  From Crosthwaite school he went
to Underbarrow and distinguished himself
there chiefly for having the pluck to stand
up to the big bully and thrash him in defence
of the oppressed youngster.  He became out
of school times an expert and ardent follower
of Isaac Walton.  Years after, he wrote an
appreciative paper which is extant on Walton
and Cotton's <i>Complete Angler</i>, which he
begins with the sentence, 'Among our most
favourite books is The Complete Angler of
Isaac Walton.'  The boys of Underbarrow
noticed that he hugged his garret where the
owls built, and was often deep in old romances
of <i>Amadis de Gaul</i> and <i>Roncesvalles</i> when
others were out and away up the fells.  But
in the holidays he followed bark-peeling, not
so much as that thus he might earn something
that would pay for his schooling, as
because in the months of May and June
when the bark-peelers went to their fragrant
task in the woods, there was a fine chance
of becoming acquainted with the life-history
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P121"></a>121}</span>
of many of our feathered visitors that were
nesting at that time.  In autumn his delight
was to be after the woodcocks, and great
was his joy,
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'With store of springes o'er his shoulder hung,<br>
  To range the open heights where woodcocks run<br>
  Along the smooth green turf.  Through half the night,<br>
  Scudding away from snare to snare, he plied<br>
  That anxious visitation.'<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
In his copy of Wordsworth's <i>Prelude</i>, the
marker, at his death, was found placed at this
passage, and he never tired of telling the
story of his woodcock adventures.
</p>

<p>
His first work in life was to act as teacher
in the Winster village school; he went thence
to be tutor to the four children of a widow
body at Cartmel Fell, but at the end of the
year gave up teaching to take the place of
a grocer's assistant at Kendal.
</p>

<p>
He was only there a year, but it was an
eventful one in William Pearson's life.  He
made the acquaintance of Benjamin Gough,
the blind botanist, and it is possible that he
was led by him into enquiry not only into
the wonders of plant life, but of the life of
that most delicate of all plants, the religious
faith of the human soul.  It is certain that
during this year William Pearson's chief
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P122"></a>122}</span>
study was the study of the Hebrew
Scriptures and the Church Doctrine, and the
end of it was that he reasoned and read
himself out of Episcopalianism into
Unitarianism, as his father had in the past
done before him.  He found rest to his
young soul in the thought of the great
Fatherhood of God, and worshipped in the old
Presbyterian Meeting House, where sometimes
in after years Wordsworth also
worshipped, and near by which lie the ashes of
the James Patrick of Kendal, who was the
original of the Wanderer in <i>The Prelude</i>.  It
may be fancy, but I like to think that it was
in that chapel that the young lad first saw
the man whose writings did more for him
all through life than any other&mdash;I mean
William Wordsworth.
</p>

<p>
From Kendal, William went, as was the
wont of many a Kendal apprentice, to a grocer's
shop in London, and at the end of three
months he returned to the Winster Vale,
broken in health from the stifle of London
air, and the fact that he had no better
resting place after long days of work in a city
store than a shake-down underneath the
counter.  He was now in his twenty-third
year.  The 'poddish' and fresh air of the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P123"></a>123}</span>
Yews set him 'agate' again, and he
determined to try Manchester life, and on the
16th March, 1803, he set out for that
metropolis of the North.  He obtained a
situation on the next day after his arrival as
clerk in the bank of James Fox &amp; Company,
in King Street, and for the next seventeen
years he endured
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The fierce confederate storm<br>
  Of sorrow barricadoed evermore<br>
  Within the walls of cities.'<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
How simple and frugal his life was there,
we may gather from the fact that out of his
first year's stipend of £75 he sent back a
deposit to one of the Kendal banks.  He
was not very happy.  He wanted friends
of his age 'who united,' as he tells us, 'those
first of blessings, virtue and knowledge,' and
they were not.  'Indeed, sir,' he writes to
James Watson of Kendal, 'I think Manchester,
in proportion to its population, very
deficient in men of cultivated understanding.
Immersed in business, or carried down the
stream of dissipation, slaves to "Mammon"
and to "Bacchus," they have seldom time for
the rational amusement of reading or for
the calm pleasure of reflection.'
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P124"></a>124}</span>
</p>

<p>
This seems somewhat priggish, but it was
the real and earnest William Pearson who
spoke.  Sociable as he was, fond of seeing
a good play, his chief delight, if he was not
out in the fields, was a book that would set
him thinking or a poem that would touch his
imagination, and Pearson was old beyond his
years.  He joined the Didactical Society,
the Mosley Street Library, subscribed to the
News Room and made one or two friends for life.
</p>

<p>
There in most uncongenial surroundings
for seventeen years he stuck to 'the drudgery
at the desk's dead wood' with one thought,
that a time would arrive when he could come
back to his native vale, and live a student's
and a naturalist's life in simple competence.
As a matter of fact his health broke down
after five years of Manchester smoke, and he
had to come back in 1808 to the Yews in his
native vale for country air and restoration.
</p>

<p>
He was at this time nothing if not a keen
sportsman, and he was, if one may judge from
a letter he sent at this time to a Kendal paper,
vexed at heart by the vigorous application of
the game laws as enforced by the worthies
of the local bench.  Three young men, who,
with nothing but a knob-stick, could run down
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P125"></a>125}</span>
a hare, had been caught hunting on Cartmel
Fell.  'We must pity the Robinsons,' he says,
'young men who can run down a hare, an
animal that often escapes the fleetest
greyhound, who pursued their sport without fear
in the open day, and so generously, that they
left a hare with the farmer on whose ground
they happened to take it.  These fine young
men have been made to pay £3 13s. 6d. for
their sport.  The age of chivalry is indeed
gone.  The ancient Greeks would have
crowned them with laurel, but this is the age
of taxation and little men.  We are fallen on
evil days; we only wish the surveyor and
commissioner had heard them at their joyous
sport, and had heard their shouts, as we did,
which made the old mountains ring again even
to Gummershow, to be echoed back from the
far-off Coniston Fells.'
</p>

<p>
It was during his Manchester residence that
he became a student of William Wordsworth.
It was not fashionable then to care for
Wordsworth's poetry, but William Pearson was never
without the Lyrical Ballads of 1805, or his
copy of <i>Poems by William Wordsworth</i>, of
1807.  The young bank clerk, who was often
heard muttering, 'I will lift mine eyes unto
the hills, whence cometh aid,' felt in these
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P126"></a>126}</span>
poems 'all the beauty of a common dawn.'  He
knew that Wordsworth walked on the
shining uplands of a noble aspiration, and was
the apostle, in a time 'that touched monied
worldlings with dismay,' of the simpler life of
honest poverty and high endeavour.  He felt
that in Wordsworth he could find that
sympathy with all things, that
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Look to the Uncreated with a countenance<br>
  Of admiration and an eye of love.'<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
He knew that Wordsworth had realised the
power of Nature to chasten and subdue
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'and intertwine<br>
  The passions that build up our human soul<br>
  Not with the mean and vulgar works of man<br>
  But with high objects and enduring things.'<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
He also knew how Wordsworth taught men
the secret of the gentle heart,
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Never to blend its pleasure or its pride,<br>
  With sorrow of the meanest thing that feels.'<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
It was this knowledge that soon made him
love rather to watch a wild bird than shoot it.
One is not surprised therefore to find him
constantly referring to Wordsworth's writings,
and yet to feel him so eminent as a man that
years after, though communing in spirit with
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P127"></a>127}</span>
him day by day, he could not summon courage
to go up the path to Rydal Mount, and
abashed at his own boldness for venturing
to call, came away from the door of the
Rydal poet, without seeing his hero, like a
thing ashamed.
</p>

<p>
It was owing to mutual love and admiration
for Wordsworth's poetry that he found in a
poor Gorton silk-weaver, Thomas Smith by
name, so congenial a companion.  The last
six years of Pearson's life at Manchester can
chiefly be known from the letters that passed
between these two friends, which towards the
end seem almost to degenerate into a series
of begging letters from a poor weaver out of
work and 'thrice dispirited.'  But this at any
rate is seen in their correspondence, that even
in abject poverty high thinking is possible,
and Wordsworth's poems seem to be medicine
for the mind; while on the other hand there
is always the ready and generous response of
the yeoman of Winster Vale, and such delicacy
in act of gift as makes one feel how finely
strung, how nobly sensitive was the mind of
the benefactor.
</p>

<p>
Pearson sends Thomas Smith a copy of <i>The
Excursion</i>.  'Your tidings about Wordsworth,'
says the poor weaver, under date of April 15,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P128"></a>128}</span>
1821, 'I will not call him Mr., he is too
great for that, were good tidings indeed; his
<i>Excursion</i> I have been longing for ever since
it was first published, but the price has been
an unsurmountable obstacle to a weaver.'
</p>

<p>
The two friends unbosom their hearts to
one another in these letters, and there is seen
something of the deep religious side of
Pearson's character in some of them.  'I
cannot,' he writes to Smith in 1831, 'conclude
without a word about what you write of your
being unhappy.  Read your Bible.  Trust in
that Good Being who gave you your existence.
Consider the many in your situation who from
ignorance and want of education have not
the arguments of hope that you have;
... only the wicked need be unhappy; at anyrate
do not despair.'  And again in 1838, 'I wish
I could console you under your troubles.  Be
thankful you have not a guilty conscience&mdash;the
greatest of evils.  Read your Bible, read
Wordsworth, Shakespeare and Milton.  Do
you go to worship, public, I mean?  You
have a chapel at the foot of your hill, join
yourself to them.'
</p>

<p>
When Smith lay dying, Pearson wrote a
letter full of tender sympathy.  'So long as
reason and memory remain, I shall never forget
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P129"></a>129}</span>
the many delightful hours we have passed
together, whether in reading some favourite
poet or rambling among the beautiful scenes
of Nature.'  'I believe,' he added, 'that
seldom have two persons come together more
in sympathy than we two, and I have often
felt that my separation from you was one of
my greatest losses in leaving your part of the
country.'
</p>

<p>
Those rambles he mentions were walking-tours
he took in 1817 through Derbyshire,
and in 1818 in the Craven country of Yorkshire.
He kept journals, and full of delightful
observation of men and things they are,
redolent of real joy in sunshine and cloud.  He
writes, 'We walked forward on this delightful
morning with vigorous steps.  The lark was
our constant companion, cheering us overhead
with her song, the fresh air of the mountains
bathed our cheeks, there was freedom from
care and the feeling of liberty
</p>

  Unprofitable, and the fever of the world<br>
  Hung not upon the beatings of our hearts.'<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
'We felt something,' he adds, 'of

<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P130"></a>130}</span>
  In which the heavy and the weary weight<br>
  Of all this unintelligible world<br>
  Is lightened: that serene and blessed mood<br>
  In which the affections gently lead us on."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
At the end of his Derbyshire journal he says
that 'the remembrance of those happy days
in Derbyshire will lie in the landscape of his
memory, like spots of stationary sunshine; they
will be to him and his friend as wells of pure
water amid desert sands to which their souls
may fly for refreshment hereafter in hours of
weariness amid the din of towns and cities and
the many shapes of joyless delight.'
</p>

<p>
Did ever city man take back to city roar
and barrenness more quiet and more profit
from a country ramble?
</p>

<p>
In his last letter to Thomas Smith, he spoke
of having left the Manchester neighbourhood.
In the autumn of 1820 he gave up his work
in the Manchester Bank.  He never could
think of his native vale without a sense of
heartsickness; his work was irksome and city
life hateful.  In his poem to the river Winster
dated 1821, he writes:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'And in the heavy time of after life,<br>
  When buried in the midst of toil and strife<br>
  In trading towns, if intermission sweet<br>
  I sought from my dull toil, my fancy fleet<br>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P131"></a>131}</span>
  Was straight amid thy vernal meads and flowers,<br>
  Thy hanging fields, wild woods, and leafy bowers.<br>
  Nor could I think of beauty on this earth,<br>
  But still 'twas seen with thee&mdash;as if thy birth<br>
  And mine had been together.  Now at ease<br>
  And free to wander whereso'er I please,<br>
  What charms I find along thy simple stream,<br>
  Beloved Winster!'<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
It is no wonder that a yeoman farmer's son
who could thus write, should have felt irresistibly
drawn from exile in Manchester to his native
vale, and we find him back at the Yews, in
correspondence, now with the editor of a county
paper, now with Miss Wordsworth, now writing
a ballad or a poem, now a natural history note,
now wandering off down Duddon Vale, and
through the Lake District, and now keenly
interested in a little dilapidated estate in the
Crosthwaite township called sometimes Borderside,
sometimes Balderside, or perhaps more
accurately in Viking phrase, Bauta-side, and
determining to go into the farming line.
</p>

<p>
He became purchaser of the Borderside
estate in 1822; at once he determined to let
it for five years, and gave his whole time and
the rent to boot, to the improvement of it.
</p>

<p>
In the summer of the same year that he
became an estatesman, he planned a tour into
Scotland.  Wordsworth wrote him a full and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P132"></a>132}</span>
particular itinerary, and William Pearson
followed the footsteps of the bard, and really
made the same journey as Wordsworth's first
excursion to Scotland.
</p>

<p>
There is an interesting note of the peasants
recollection of Burns in Ayrshire, and of the
Sabbath manners of certain of the Auchterarder
folk, but the journal otherwise is a little
tiresome.
</p>

<p>
The next ten years were spent in the not
very profitable work of mending the fences
and outbuildings of Borderside, and then of
attempting to make its crops pay the rent
and leave something over.  But in 1841 he
'declined' farming, not without the secret joy
of getting back to his mother's house at the
Yews, where all his books were stored, and
where the <i>Encyclopædia</i>, just bound, was
awaiting him.
</p>

<p>
He had not been idle, he had made the Corn
Laws a study, and had concluded that they
were unjust, cruel, and impolitic.  He had done
what he could to get the Kendal folk to abolish
the old system of selling fruit by baskets, or
paniers containing sixteen quarts, and had
introduced the better system of selling by
weight.
</p>

<p>
In the spring of 1842 his mother died, and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P133"></a>133}</span>
now, at the age of sixty-two, William Pearson
felt free to marry.  He married Ann Greenhow
of Heversham in May.
</p>

<p>
He was by instinct a tiller of the ground;
he used to say that 'no one felt more dependence
upon God than the farmer in his fields.'  He
turned his attention to fruit culture,
planted a large orchard with 300 trees and
two lesser ones, and felt that he had not lived
in vain.  It was during this period that he
began making notes of the habits of the bird
and beast life round about him.  Some
observations on the habits of the hedgehog which
he sent in 1836 to Mr. Wordsworth were
sent by the poet to the members of the Kendal
Natural History Society, of which Pearson
had been a member almost from the first.
</p>

<p>
The result of this communication evoked,
so Cornelius Nicholson, the then secretary,
tells us, so much enthusiasm, that a class was
determined on for mutual instruction in the
habits and distinctive faculties of birds and
beasts.  It was Pearson's habit to attend the
monthly discussion meeting of this Society,
and he thought nothing of setting off after an
early tea and walking in nearly seven miles
to Kendal and walking back by starlight after
the lecture.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P134"></a>134}</span>
</p>

<p>
It was to this part of his life between the
years 1825 and 1833 that belong the glimpses
of his intimacy with the Rydal Mount family,
as shown by the letters, chiefly from Dorothy
Wordsworth, that have been preserved to us.
It is clear that William Pearson was a most
welcome guest at Rydal.  Excursions up
Helvellyn are planned with the Wordsworths,
and natural history notes are exchanged.
The letters are chiefly interesting as giving
us hints of the simplicity of the life there, and
are often full of thanks to him for a panier
of apples, or a leash of partridges, they
contain a request for straw for the stables,
they seek his advice in purchase of a pony,
they send requisition for more potatoes and
the like.  William Pearson was looked upon
as the henchman who could be best trusted
to supply the Rydal Mount with farm produce,
and it is clear that to do the bidding of the
bard and be steward of his stable economics
was a real pleasure to him.
</p>

<p>
He also sent to Dorothy Wordsworth's
sick-room just those delightful little nature
anecdotes which cheered her in her retirement.
He admired and honoured the poet's
sister.  'Never,' says he in one of his letters
to Smith in 1832, 'have I known a more
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P135"></a>135}</span>
amiable woman.  Her understanding and
judgment are of the highest order.  I have
heard Mr. Wordsworth say that he had been
more indebted to her judgment than to that
of any other person.'
</p>

<p>
The correspondence gives little facts and
dates of household matters that are interesting
to students of the poet's life at Rydal.  For
example, we learn on May 5, 1830, that on
the next day will be finished the new terrace,
to the poet's satisfaction; we learn also of
Wordsworth's constant trouble from 1833 and
onward by reason of the inflammation of his
eyes.  We hear incidentally how poor a
horseman, but how good a walker the poet is,
and the simplicities and hospitalities of Rydal
Mount are brought before us.
</p>

<p>
But it was not only as steward of the farm
and orchard that Pearson was so truly
honoured by the Wordsworths.  It was because
the poet felt that in him he had a real lover
of his art, and a real understander of his
poetry and his philosophy.  One is not
surprised to find that Wordsworth thanked
him on the occasion when, in the Kendal
paper, the worthy yeoman took up pen in
defence of the poet.  And those who years
after honoured the dead poet's memory&mdash;his
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P136"></a>136}</span>
personal friends, Dr. Davy and others&mdash;were
grateful to William Pearson when, in 1854,
he championed, in a letter full of feeling and
knowledge, the Protestantism of the bard,
which had been called in question by a lecturer
of the Protestant Alliance in Kendal, who had
described Wordsworth's poetry as being 'one
of the principal means of the revival of
priestly domination in the Church of England.'
</p>

<p>
It is very touching to see how really he
valued the friendship of the poet he so well
understood and so honoured.  'What claim
have I,' he wrote to Dorothy Wordsworth,
'on the notice of a man like your brother?
My chief obligations to him for conferring on
me his society and hospitable notice I hope I
shall feel to the latest hours of my
life.'  Writing to Wordsworth from Borderside under
date 1849, he says, 'I felt very grateful for
your letter.  On reading the first few lines I
was sorry to think how much Mrs. Wordsworth's
handwriting had changed, but when I
found it was indeed your own hand the tears
came into my eyes.  I shall preserve this
kind memorial and shall not part with it till
I part with everything in life.'  These were
the words of a real hero-worshipper, and he
had cause for hero-worship.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P137"></a>137}</span>
</p>

<p>
What Wordsworth's poetry did to inspire
and keep pure and true and serene the heart
of William Pearson, it will still do for men of
humble country life in the years that are to
be.  We need to-day more of soul among our
farmer folk, we want a <i>vade mecum</i> for the
tiller of the soil that shall lift his soul to
Heaven.  I cannot doubt that if men would
study Wordsworth and receive his 'heart into
their own,' there would be dignity and
happiness added to many a daleside home.
</p>

<p>
To return to William Pearson.  He found
the farm life on the whole a happy one.  He
would not have given it up had he not determined
to marry.  His orchards prospered, and
his hay grass was generally well got.  His
frugal ways ensured him competency, and all
day and every day he was learning more of
Nature's secrets, more of the pleasant ways of
birds and beasts about him.  He was making
observations, too, on the changes that had
come over the vale of Lythe and the
neighbouring fells and common lands, since the
packhorse had ceased to be, and the common
enclosures and the larch planters had come in.
</p>

<p>
But his ears were open also to the quaint
sayings and superstitions, and his eyes were on
the quaint ways and customs of the dalesmen
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P138"></a>138}</span>
amongst whom he dwelt and moved, and
these observations bore good fruit in the
paper written in 1841, the year before his
marriage, for the Kendal Natural History
Society, entitled 'A Sketch of some of the
Existing and Recent Superstitions of Westmoreland.'
</p>

<p>
It was doubtless a source of gratification to
William Pearson that the son of the poet
should be the officiating minister in Bowness
Church the day he led his wife to the altar,
in May of 1842.  And he must needs have
been pleased on his return to Low House
after a wedding jaunt through the lakes, to
find that Hartley Coleridge, who had called to
congratulate him on his marriage, left behind
him an impromptu sonnet.  It had, as most
of Hartley's sonnets have, a little touch of
description of the life both of himself and of
his friend, the gentle estatesman:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'A little man of solitary life<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And half an idiot too&mdash;more helpless still&mdash;<br>
  Can wish all joy to thee and to thy wife;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy love must be as constant as thy will.<br>
  My gentle friend, how happy mayst thou be!<br>
  Thou hast a wife to pray&mdash;and pray with thee.'<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
During the coming June of 1842 Pearson
took his wife to the Continent.  He had long
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P139"></a>139}</span>
planned this trip; writing to his friend Thomas
Smith in April of 1841, to tell him of his
intended venture on 'that variety of untried
being,' marriage, he says that Mr. Wordsworth
has advised him to make a Swiss and
Italian tour before age renders him unfit for
foot-travel, and adds that his future wife 'is
an excellent walker, and is quite willing to
share the fatigue, and he is sure she will
share the pleasure.'  There is a note of
simplicity in this intention to see the Swiss
and Italian lakes afoot&mdash;the bridegroom now
more than three score years, but a 'young
heart travels many a mile,' and William
Pearson's heart was young to the last.
</p>

<p>
Wordsworth supplied him with an itinerary
which he faithfully followed.  After the tour
they stayed on until the spring at Versoix,
near Geneva, and his journal shows that he
was busy making naturalist notes all the
while.  There is a touching note in his journal
of his delight on getting back to his
Westmoreland home.  The blue mountains and the
well-known fells, and the ivy-covered cottage
of Low House, and the happy greetings from
beloved friends.  These deeply moved him.
</p>

<p>
There was no suitable house for the happy
couple in Crosthwaite, and after staying at
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P140"></a>140}</span>
Low House for the winter, he went into
lodgings at High Crag.  Lodgings were not
William Pearson's ideal of home life, and
though he was a man of sixty-seven he
determined in 1847 to build a house on his
own estate.
</p>

<p>
It was a glad day for him when, as he tells
us, on the last day of July, 1848, he crept
into the bosom of his own cheerful cot 'with
measureless content,' a cottage 'unclothed by
rough-cast,' as he told Wordsworth, 'but
exhibiting a goodly row of chimneys with
pretty round tops on square pedestals, the
only specimens yet in Crosthwaite of the
revived good old fashion.'
</p>

<p>
We have a poet's description of this Borderside
home from the pen of Perceval Graves,
who, writing from Dovenest in 1862, thus
describes it:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Red roses flush its native stone,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grassy slope, the rocky mount<br>
  Are gay with flowers,&mdash;a shadowy fount<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Murmurs with cool delicious tone.<br>
  Beneath, an orchard far and wide<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its blossom on its front displays;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the valley friendly rays<br>
  From neighbour houses hail Borderside.'<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Here for the next eight years dwelt the
refined and thoughtful yeoman, reading such
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P141"></a>141}</span>
books as he felt he could afford to buy, such
books as he could borrow from Kendal, or
were lent him by Coleridge or Perceval
Graves or Wordsworth; corresponding with
such naturalists as Waterton and Gough, such
students as Perceval Graves and Dr. Davy,
keeping up constant communion with the
friends at Rydal Mount; getting hold of the
best that could be had of the scientific treatises
of the day; dipping here and there into
theologic problems; studying his Shakespeare and
his Milton, enjoying his Carlyle, his Burns,
and his Scott, his Reed's <i>English Literature</i>,
impressing, when he met him, such a man as
Sir William Hamilton, examining the theories
of Agazziz and Brewster as to moraine and
glacier action, comparing his own natural
history observations with those of Waterton
and White of Selborne; and from time to
time, when he had returned from some ride on
'Nep' or 'Camel,' his favourite ponies, sitting
down to chronicle the beauty of the day's
outing, or the wild life of bird and beast he
had observed.  Amongst the latter must be
noted his papers on the partridge and the
squirrel, in 1846; on the woodgrouse, that 'new
bird' which appears to have come to Colthouse
first in the autumn of 1845 (this paper was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P142"></a>142}</span>
written in 1850), and again on the hagworm,
1852; 'Notes on Characters and Habits of
Domestic Animals, 1854'; and 'A few Recent
Notices in Natural History, 1855.'
</p>

<p>
All Pearson's prose has a dignity and simplicity
and directness that makes one realise he
had been a reader of the masters of English
style, but it makes one feel also that he is a
poet at heart, as he writes his prose.  Take
for example his account of the glede or
kite&mdash;alas! long vanished from our land, though
nesting at the ferry as late as the beginning
of last century;&mdash;'I have seen,' says he, 'the
glede and his beautiful flight, no words of
mine can adequately describe it.  It was on a
windy day in autumn or winter that he
generally made his appearance.  Imagine a bird
measuring five feet between the tips of his
wings.  To glide along it required apparently
no mechanical effort, no fluttering of the wings,
not the tremor of a feather.  It was not
flying but sailing on the bosom of the air, as
if by an effort of the will, such ease, such
grace, such dignity.'
</p>

<p>
The evenings at Borderside were spent in
reading.  A mellow musical voice with much
feeling in it, would render a passage from
some favourite poet, and as often as not the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P143"></a>143}</span>
old man's voice would falter and he would say,
'I cannot go on,' and with tears rolling down
his cheeks he would put the book down.
Perceval Graves, his great friend of the later
years, would ofttimes come over for high
discourse and heart communion from Dovenest
to Borderside.  He described those pleasant
visits thus:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'And when our cheerful meal was o'er,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A meal which friendship seemed to bless<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And elegance and homeliness<br>
  With charm we scarce had known before.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  How swiftly flew the hours away,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As thought and feeling deeply stored<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By mind and heart all forth were poured<br>
  In loving faith and lively play!'<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The summer of 1856 was memorable for a
waterspout that fell in hay-time on the 8th of
August, upon Carnigill, near Borrow Bridge;
we who travel by the L.N.W.R. from Tebay
to the south can still see the wounds upon
the mountain side the fury of the torrent
made.  The phenomenon was minutely
described by the old meteorologist in a letter
to Mr. Davy.  It was the last August he
would see.
</p>

<p>
The long walks over fell and moor gave
way to pony-back, and pony-back gave way
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P144"></a>144}</span>
to a carriage.  It was clear to all who knew
that delicately chiselled face and noble brow
of the yeoman poet and naturalist, that with
all his mental powers clear and his eye
undimmed, his natural strength was abating.  In
the spring of 1856 the Winster folk noticed
that though he visited, as was his wont, all
the orchards for miles round, he visited them
in his gig, and men knew by his constant
cough that his old enemy, bronchitis, was
pressing him sore.  But every sunny day found
him sitting with his book under the shadow
of the famous ash tree at Borderside, and still
at night time, if the stars were clear, they
saw a tall figure wrapped in a plaid, and stick
in hand, pacing slowly the garden path,
before the door was shut and lights went out.
</p>

<p>
As for his own light, that went out, painlessly
almost as it seemed, on December 16th.
A day or two before, he had gone to the
window of his sick room, and said, 'In
another month the snowdrops will be here.'  The
snowdrops came, but alas! for eyes of
others almost too dim for tears to see them.
On the day of his death, or more properly,
his falling on sleep, the sunset brightened in
the west, and the dying man with the instinct
of an observer keen to the last, turned his
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P145"></a>145}</span>
face to the window to see the glory grow.
Then he sighed and passed to other glory
beyond all sunsetting.
</p>

<p>
Of his work that remains, little need be said.
It is always thoughtful, accurate of observation,
pure in style, refined in diction, and
delicate in poetic appreciation.  One much
regrets that he who had in 1808 espoused the
'Terza Rima' should have so soon quitted
the sonnet's scanty plot of ground and left so
few examples of his work.  Amongst the
miscellaneous papers and letters on natural
history that remain are three which we of this
county cannot be too thankful for.  One is a
paper 'On certain changes that have taken
place of late years in a part of the Lake
District,' with its notes of 'pack-horse-routes,'
'implements of primitive husbandry,' 'the
introduction of larch planting,' 'commons
enclosure,' and with its interesting account of
the ancient Lythe Marsh.
</p>

<p>
Another is a paper in form of six letters to
Thomas Gough containing 'notes on a few
subjects in the natural history of Crosthwaite
and Lythe, and the valley of Winster.'  He
prefaced this series of letters with an apparent
quotation which really was his own saying
and which, as a lover of St. Francis and of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P146"></a>146}</span>
all his true followers, I dare to repeat.&mdash;'These
lonely denizens of the earth, our
fellow pilgrims on the journey of life, have
their appointed tasks as we have, set out by
the great Creator.'  There spoke the heart of
the wise old Winster estatesman, who long
had known the bond of love that binds the

The last two papers to be mentioned are
'The Sketches of some of the existing and
recent Superstitions of Westmoreland': most
valuable these are, as written just in the nick
of time.  The two generations that have
passed since he collected his material and
penned his notes, have ceased to hand on the
traditional sayings and become too matter of
fact to be 'boddered wid sic things as Charms
or Boggles or Dobbies or Barguests or Wisemen
or Witches.'

<p>
There is no one in the county of Westmoreland
to-day who would care to take their
children when plagued with the kink-cough
up to Cartmel-fell, on chance of clipping a
hair from the cross on an ass's back and
then tying it round the bairn's neck as a
sovereign remedy for the troublesome whoop.
</p>

<p>
But if it had not been for William Pearson
I doubt if we should have known that the
Winster dalesfolk, notwithstanding that the
Cross was set here in the clearing so many
centuries ago, were actually fire-worshippers
and carrying on the rites of Baal with their
Beltane-fires as late as the year of Our Lord
1840.  Pearson tells us he talked with a
farmer who had actually been present at the
sacrifice by fire of a calf in this neighbourhood,
and that there were two places within
the memory of men then living, Fell Side in
Crosthwaite and Hodge Hill on Cartmel-fell,
where, to prevent the death of calves after
birth, large fires were kindled in the open air
near to the farm house and a living calf
laid upon them and burnt to death.
</p>

<p>
As for the reality of this superstitious relic
of sun-worship, in the year 1840, William
Pearson actually witnessed it here in
Crosthwaite, and, with a quotation from his paper
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P148"></a>148}</span>
upon this point, I will close this notice of his
life and work:
</p>

<p>
'The Need Fire has again made its appearance.
There is at present a rumour of a
dreadful epidemic among cattle, which has
shown itself in different places in this part of
our country, to which it has been coming
slowly up from the South, where it prevailed
last summer.  On Sunday afternoon, the 15th
of last November, returning from Kendal by
way of Brigsteer, when I reached the brow of
the hill that overlooks that pleasant village,
and from whence there is a glorious prospect,
I was somewhat surprised to see, in Crosthwaite,
two or three large masses of white
smoke "rising up like the smoke of a furnace."  I
thought it was lime-burning, from some kilns
that are not usually occupied.  But when I
reached Crosthwaite, I found myself in the
immediate neighbourhood of one of these
"smokes," which was rising very thickly below
the Church Tower.  I enquired of a young
woman standing in the road what was the
meaning of all this smoke.  "Oh," said she,
"it is the Need Fire."  Well, thought I,
much as I have heard of it, I have never seen
the Need Fire.  I will not miss this opportunity
of having ocular evidence of all its
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P149"></a>149}</span>
mysteries.  On reaching che spot, I found the
fire burning in the narrow lane called Kirk
Lane, within about twenty yards of the Kirk
Tower, and about half a dozen cattle huddled
together and kept close to the fire, and
amongst the smoke, by a number of men and
boys standing on each side of them, in that
narrow lane.  Sometimes they drove them
through the fire, and such was the thickness
of the smoke that I could scarcely perceive
the actors in this strange ceremony&mdash;men and
cattle.  "So," said I, "you are giving them a
smoke."  "Yes," replied the owner of the
cows, "we wish to be like our neighbours."  "But
have you got the real Need Fire?"  "Yes,
we believe so, it came down Crook
yesterday."  Now I had heard that it had been
at Low Levens a few days before, so that
this superstitious fire was evidently moving
about in all directions through the length and
breadth of the land: nor do they appear to
give it any rest, even on Sundays!'

<h3>
JOSEPH HAWELL, A SKIDDAW SHEPHERD.
</h3>

<p>
Did you know Joseph Hawell of Lonscale?
</p>

<p>
Nearly everybody within sight of Skiddaw
did, and knew him to honour him and to speak
well of him.
</p>

<p>
Not a ram-show nor a Herdwick prize show,
not a clipping feast nor shepherd's meeting,
but 'kenned' Joseph Hawell; and of later
years most of the 'Yellow' or Conservative
meetings in the district had seen his manly
form and heard his manly words in what he
used to call 'the national cause.'  For Joseph
Hawell was a Conservative and a Unionist;
'thoro'-bred' he used to say, for his father
and his mother had felt as he did in matters
political, and he thought 'they had mixed a
laal bit yaller wid his poddish' when he was
a boy.  At any rate he would have liked
well enough to have branded his fleecy
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P151"></a>151}</span>
Skiddaw darlings with the words 'For King
and Country,' and used a yellow 'dip' if
such had been in existence.
</p>

<p>
I knew his old father&mdash;him of Longlands
in Uldale&mdash;later of Lonscale; and a better
informed man, a man, that is, better read in
the news of the day, was hardly to be found
in the farm-houses round Keswick.  So like
Dean Stanley of Westminster he was in face
that I would introduce him to my friends as
'the Dean,' and by his side, as he 'cracked'
on the things of state, sat usually one of the
sweetest-faced, gentlest-natured of women, his
good wife, whose maiden name was Jane
Walker, of Stockdale.  They had married
in the 'fifties' of last century, and she
had borne him five children&mdash;John, Jane
(who died in girlhood), Robert, Joseph, and
Ann.
</p>

<p>
Joseph was a Christmas present to the old
oak cradle at Longlands Farm, for he was
born on the 24th December, 1854; and he
grew up, with John and Robert, to be as
passionately fond of sheep as his father.
Never a boy for books much at school, he
still as a youngster was ever fond of helping
on the Fell, and of training the shepherd's
dogs; and rare training he had himself.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P152"></a>152}</span>
</p>

<p>
His father had, from a present of ten
gimmer lambs, given him by his father when
he was a young man, reared up quite a fine
race of the blackfaced Herdwicks, and was,
by the time the lads could bear him company,
flockmaster of 500 sheep on Frozen Fell and
Wylie Ghyll, and of 300 in the Forest, as it
is called&mdash;the great heathery waste in the
basin at the back of Skiddaw.
</p>

<p>
Joseph grew up strong and lusty as a
shepherd should grow, and together with his
brothers, took to wrestling as all shepherds
in Cumberland ought to do; but the lads, as
they grew up, became so fond of the sheep
and so devoted to their father, that as soon
as he, seeing that they were likely to be
drawn into the ring, and to lose some of
their interest in the Herdwick sheep, begged
them to give up the wrestling, they gave
it up; and henceforth these brothers' one
aim in life seemed to be how they could
most help their father to improve the
Herdwick breed, and maintain his honour as a
shepherd.
</p>

<p>
In 1869 the family migrated from Uldale
to the secluded farm on Col. Watson's estate,
between Lonscale and Saddleback; and what
success the Hawells, father and sons, obtained
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P153"></a>153}</span>
as breeders of pure Herdwicks can be seen
by any who will call to-day at the Farm,
and ask to be shown the prizes and cards
that literally cover the walls from floor to
ceiling.
</p>

<p>
The old man, who had struggled with
storm on Skiddaw through his laborious life,
failed in health, suffered as shepherds often
do from terrible rheumatism, and was troubled
with asthma.  At last he felt obliged to leave
the ingle-nook and take to his bed upstairs;
but his love of the shepherd's life was still
so strong upon him that a few days before
he died he insisted on seeing one of the prize
Herdwick rams, and the sons had a tough
job to get it to 'clim' the 'stee' and stand
in the presence of the dying man.  The old
man felt death coming upon him shortly
after, but he told those who watched they
need not trouble to fetch the doctor, as he
knew his hour had come, and he was ready
to 'gang' home.
</p>

<p>
I wrote this sonnet at the time of his death:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The sheep are bleating in the fell-side field,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kine call sadly from the homestead near,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But thou art far away, thou dost not hear.<br>
  A greater Shepherd, for thy feet, doth wield<br>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P154"></a>154}</span>
  The rod that thro' the vale of death can yield<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sole comfort.  Round thy bed and round thy bier<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trophies of thy hand in letters clear,<br>
  Speak; but we speak not: grief our lips has sealed.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Farewell, where Glenderaterra pours apace<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich music from her thousand upland springs!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy name, old friend, the Lonscale streamlet sings;<br>
  King-Shepherd thou of Skiddaw's fleecy race;<br>
  And still in memory we behold thy face,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lined by laborious morns and evenings.<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
And on the headstone in Greystoke churchyard,
that records Edward Hawell's burial,
may be seen the following lines:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Here lies a simple shepherd, one who strove<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To leave behind a fairer, fuller flock;<br>
  Lead him, Great Master Shepherd, in thy love,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To wells of life from the Eternal Rock!<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Before he died he had the comfort of
seeing Joseph wedded to as good a daughter-in-law
as ever lived.  It was but in keeping
with the whole life of the household that
Joseph should have first met Margaret Roberts
at the Gillbanks' clipping.  The love for all
time that first began at the shearing, went on
smoothly till that other Master of the Shears,
one men call Death, cut so cruelly the knot
that Love in this life had tied.  Married in
1886, Joseph was happy as man could be; he
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P155"></a>155}</span>
was blessed with a son John, and a daughter
Sarah Jane.
</p>

<p>
With plenty of work on the Fells by day
for himself, his brother, and his men to do,
he yet found time to study at night.  He
took to politics as his father before him had
taken to them, and, having gained confidence
in public speaking, he worked hard at his
speeches and the preparing of them.
</p>

<p>
Of books he had not many but good;
and he specially delighted in biographies and
history.  He never tired of reading of the
<i>Spacious Times of Great Elizabeth</i>, the
<i>History of Wellingtons Wars</i>, or of <i>Nelson's
Exploits</i>; and when the Royal Jubilee and
Armada Tercentenary came round, no stronger
hand or more willing heart was found in the
whole neighbourhood to build up the huge
bonfire stack on Skiddaw top than Joseph Hawell's.
As I write I can see him, the perspiration
streaming down his honest face, building
away with the peats, and handing up the
paraffin, bucket by bucket; and hoping, as
he told us then, there was not a man in
canny Cumberland but would feel the fiery
glow of a patriot's heart that night.
</p>

<p>
But he will never help us on Skiddaw top
more; and never, alas, shall we go to the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P156"></a>156}</span>
shepherds' meeting in Wylie Ghyll with him
again, or see him at the ram fair, or hear
him at a 'yaller' speech day, or sit with him
at his own fireside and 'crack' on about the
Herdwicks.
</p>

<p>
It is thought that influenza laid its deadly
hand upon him early in the year 1891, and
simultaneously he had some ailment of the
gums&mdash;toothache he called it.  It must have
been something more serious; he went off
to Keswick to see the doctor: the doctor
lanced the gum, but the wound took bad
ways, and within a day or so the strong
man was in bed, weak and delirious.
</p>

<p>
He wished to be up and after the sheep.
Must be about his father's business!  And,
on a cold Spring day, Friday, February
20th, an angel came to the lonely farmstead
of Lonscale, to bid the brave man's spirit
fare the way that all who really wish to
do that Heavenly Father's business must go
uncomplainingly.  And still Joseph Hawell's
heart was where it had ever been&mdash;at home
in England.  He thought that some strange
hands were taking him away by force to
another land, and the last words that he spoke
were these:
</p>

<p>
'No! if I must die, I will at least die an
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P157"></a>157}</span>
Englishman on English ground!'  And so
he died.
</p>

<p>
The strong hand of one stronger than
man had taken him; and in a few days
more, on February 23rd, hands tender and
strong, the hands of an affectionate brother
and true friends, bore the body of a shepherd,
dead in his prime&mdash;for he was but 36
years old&mdash;down through the cow-pasture
and over the gurgling Glenderaterra, and
so through the silent Brundholme woods
above the wailing Greta away to its rest
in English earth beneath the shadow of the
old church of St. Kentigern, in the Crosthwaite
valley, within sight of that horned hill
of Skiddaw he had loved so well.  The
people of Keswick begged that his body
might be carried through their sorrowful
town that opportunity might be given of
showing sympathy and respect.  And many
a stalwart yeoman came to the Homegoing.
Little they said, but they felt much as they
moved in their dark market-carts toward the
burial.
</p>

<p>
'Eh, but what! it's a terrible loss for us
all!'  'The best man amang us gone.'  'We
all mun ga when t' time comes, but it's hard
bearing is this.'  'Niver a handier man wi'
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P158"></a>158}</span>
t' sheep i' t' whoale forest.'  'Niver a better
man clim't t' fell; a decent, stiddy man
as iver was; niver heard a wrang word from
him.'  'Eh, but! it's past finding out t' way
young uns goes, and auld ones stays.'  'Poor
lass, she's lost as good a mate as ever woman
had.'  'Poor barns, they've lost a fadder
afore they kent him.'  And so sorrowfully
they turned away from the grave,
whereon flowers had been strewn and
wreaths laid by hands of men who in their
common regret forgot all party differences
and thought only of Joseph Hawell, as a
man the 'Blues and Yellows' were alike
proud of in life, and alike determined to
honour in death.
</p>

<p>
I was a traveller in foreign lands when
the news of Joseph Hawell's death reached
me, and I felt for a moment stunned.  As
I realised it, it seemed to me as if I did
not care to see Skiddaw again.  He was a
piece of it; and Skiddaw without him would
be no Skiddaw at all, such an ideal yeoman
shepherd; so tender-hearted to the yeanlings;
so true to his mountain flock; such a man
among men, honest and upright, reliable;
one always knew somehow that if Joe was
present, men right and left of him would
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P159"></a>159}</span>
behave like gentlemen; so high-minded and
bent on the 'Just and True'; and, 'as the
great ones only are, in his simplicity
sublime.'  His influence was wider and deeper
than he had dreamed of, and I felt that with
Joe Hawell a power that had worked for
righteousness in a whole fell-side community,
had passed as far as visible form goes from
the earth.
</p>

<p>
On reaching home, it was with a sad heart
that I neared the solitary fell-side farm that
had been so darkened with loss.  There was
the same kitchen; the fiddle was on the wall;
the bacon flitches hung from the rafter; the
stuffed heads of the two old favourite
shepherd dogs, 'Dainty' and 'Rob,' looked out
from under the triumphal arch of sickles from
the wall; the gun rested close by; the
medicine horn and lambing bottle were in
their places, and the old row of books that
the father and he had so often turned to for
thought and inspiration, were in their
shelf&mdash;but there was no Joe!  Robert took me by
the hand and bade me sit on the settle, and
he would tell me all about it.  The poor wife
said nothing, but just rose quietly and began
to spread the table and set on tea, and when
I urged that I would not have her fash
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P160"></a>160}</span>
herself so or put herself out of the way for me,
she urged that it would have been Joe's wish,
and I said no more.
</p>

<p>
Then the dogs came in.  'Ah,' said Robert,
't' rough un, "Jess," has not forgitten her
master yet.  She was sair put out o' t' way
when my brother lay ill, whined at nights
and would not be comforted; and she has
only just now, after ten weeks' coaxing,
consented to follow me when I go to the
Fell.'
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-160"></a>
<br>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-160.jpg" alt="JOSEPH HAWELL.">
<br>
JOSEPH HAWELL.
</p>

<p>
'And did you have no thought of Joseph's
worsening,' I said, 'when he took ill?'
</p>

<p>
'No,' said Robert, 'but rather a strange
thing happened just a week before.  I am
not superstitious, and I said little about it.
But I woke early just as it was beginning
to be dawn and saw a sad face looking upon
me.  I knew the face well, it was Joe's wife's
sister, and I thought I was dreaming and sat
up, and the face still looked very sadly and
then faded away, and I felt it must be a
vision.  I have wondered since if it was
meant as a token to us.  She was the first
person, however, that came to help us when
Joe died.  It is singular, is it not?  Eh
dear! but it's a sair heart that I have as I go
shepherding now; for it's when I'm amang
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P161"></a>161}</span>
t' sheep I mostly what seem to miss him.  It
comes ower me t' warst when I am looking at
t' ewes that we used to talk ower together.
You would like to see some of the letters, I
daresay, we received when poor Joe went.'  And
saying this, the stalwart man, who loved
his brother as tenderly as a woman, put a
bundle of letters into my hand.
</p>

<p>
'But,' said I, as I gave back these precious
documents to the owner, 'did he not leave
any papers behind him?  He is spoken of in
one letter as gifted beyond ordinary measure
as a public speaker.'
</p>

<p>
'Well,' replied the brother, 'he left very
little in writing; but you know we kept his
speeches.  They are scattered up and down
the newspapers.'  And following into the
Herdwick-prize room, I soon found myself
deep in the speeches Joseph Hawell had
from time to time delivered in the political
cause he championed.
</p>

<p>
I asked if he took much trouble in the
preparing of his speeches, and I was told
that he did; worked hard for nights beforehand,
and sometimes, as our greater orators
have done, learned a bit of his intended
speech by heart.  Joseph had as library, up
there in the rafter-smoke, some old 17th and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P162"></a>162}</span>
18th century tomes, full of the breath of
English spoken pure.  English history was
his chief study; but 'here,' said the good
wife sadly, 'is a book he oft read in,
particularly on Sunday afternoons.'  It was a
magnificent folio copy of <i>The Whole Duty
of Man</i>, <i>The Gentleman's Calling</i>, <i>The Art
of Contentment</i>, and <i>The Christian
Birthright</i>, printed by Norton, at Oxford, in 1695.
As I turned over its well-thumbed pages I
thought that Joseph Hawell had gone to
good models for his masterful English, and
had drunk wholesome draughts of goodly
thought and wisdom as he studied.
</p>

<p>
'Did he leave no other written papers?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, he left a few songs he wrote from
time to time.'
</p>

<p>
I asked to see them.  'God Save Ireland
from Disunion,' was the title of one; another,
in rough copy, was a sheep-shearing song.
</p>

<p>
Had Joseph written anything else?  Yes;
there was just one letter or two he had left
behind him in rough copy, and I was welcome
to see them if I cared.  I did care; and was
rewarded.
</p>

<p>
He had latterly been a bit troubled in his
mind by a friend who had what are called
'free-thinking notions.'  And Joe, who was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P163"></a>163}</span>
as dead against that kind of cant as any
religious cant&mdash;and he was, as I can testify,
hard upon this latter&mdash;had delivered his soul.
</p>

<p>
The letter was written on February 9th,
1891, and the hand that wrote it was cold
and stiff on February 20th.  I dare to look
upon this letter as the yeoman shepherd's last
will and testament.  It runs as follows:
</p>

<p>
'DEAR FRIEND,&mdash;I have received your
books, and am much obliged.  I have not
yet got them read thoroughly, but so far they
have but caused a reaction in my mind in
favour of the Christian religion, and led me
to have recourse to some fine old books
written more than a hundred years ago, in a
bold and intelligent hand, proving that
astronomy and science are a powerful proof of the
might and majesty of an Almighty Creator.
</p>

<p>
'Could you follow up your science by
winging your way to the highest star of
observation, you would there see other skies
expanded and other planets and systems
established, each giving harmony and perfection
of attention to time by the nicest rule.
Then wend your way past other ten thousand
worlds, and at the end of this vast tour you
would still be muddling in the suburbs of
creation, only to find that no imagination can
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P164"></a>164}</span>
fix the limits of His creating hand, and that
conceited, ignorant, and insignificant man is
absolutely unable to comprehend the grandeur
and correctness of His magnificent workmanship.
Then am I to be told that the builder
of this stupendous structure is incapable of
such a paltry performance as taking possession
of our souls and restoring our lifeless
bodies at His own good will and pleasure?
</p>

<p>
'I find,' he adds, 'Carlyle's work very
instructive, and many of the passages furnish
evidence of the existence of the great Disposer
of all events.'
</p>

<p>
I said this should stand as Joseph Hawell's
last will and testament.  No; there was
another letter, written evidently just at the
end of last year, in which he begs of a
neighbour the loan of a horse and gear to enable
him to bring down on a sledge from Lonscale
Crag one of the finest single stones there.
He wishes to set it up in some field on the
farm, and have his father's name upon it and
his father's deeds and prowess as a breeder
of Herdwick sheep, with a single verse of
descriptive poetry beneath, and he feels sure
that his friend will lend a hand 'to erect a
monument to at least one member of the
Hawell family whose stainless, honourable,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P165"></a>165}</span>
and straightforward life will always be pointed
to with pride by his descendants.'
</p>

<p>
Joseph Hawell! the horses have gone, and
the sledge has brought its heavy burden to the
home-farm; and on it are engraved two names
instead of one, for there are those who honour
the son who would so have honoured his sire.
There by that mountain path they both of
them knew so well of old is the grey memorial
cross set, and on it is carved, in symbol of
eternity, the endless knot their Norse
forefathers used.  A simple verse is engraved at
the base.
</p>

<p>
Those who pass the 'gale' for the meadows
of Lonscale, to breast the back of Blencathra,
or to climb the slopes of Skiddaw, shall surely
learn that our Cumberland mountains still as
of old breed men of high purpose and noble
endeavour; and that still, from following the
sheep, God calls His chosen ones by lives
of kindliness, simplicity, and straightforward
goodness, to guide their brothers in the path

<h3>
A FAMOUS YEW-TREE.
</h3>

<p>
There is a passage in George Fox's <i>Journal</i>
that brings one face to face with a brave man
of God, reveals the spirit of true martyrdom,
and makes one envious of his dazzling courage:
</p>

<p>
'Now were great threatenings given forth
in Cumberland that if ever I came there again
they would take away my life.  When I heard
it, I was drawn to go to Cumberland, and
went to the same parish whence these
threatenings came, but they had not power to
touch me.'
</p>

<p>
It is a passage that attracts one to the
apostle of the leathern-apron, and makes one
desire to know the scenes of his life's travail.
It was not to be wondered at, therefore, that
when one found oneself at Keswick in a
neighbouring valley to Lorton, one should
wish to visit one of the places ever associated
with his memory, and see the spot whence
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P167"></a>167}</span>
the echoes of the preacher's voice have never
died.
</p>

<p>
Associated with this wish to follow the
footsteps of George Fox, was the desire to see
the Yew-tree, 'Pride of Lorton Vale,' which,
on the day of Fox's sermon, provided seats
for the listeners.  For the famous yew-trees
in the Lake District are becoming each year
fewer.  It is true that the great yew in
Tilberthwaite is still standing, but that famous
hollow trunk that kept alive the name of the
mission preacher St. Patrick, in Patrick's Dale
or Patterdale, has fallen; and the great winter
storm of 1883 worked havoc upon Seathwaite's
sacred brotherhood:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Those fraternal four of Borrowdale,<br>
  Joined in one solemn and capacious grove;<br>
  Huge trunks!&mdash;and each particular trunk a growth<br>
  Of intertwisted fibres serpentine<br>
  Up-coiling and inveterately convolved&mdash;<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
are now a wreck,&mdash;one fell, the others were
riven to pieces.
</p>

<p>
Here in the Lake District, by command of
bluff King Hal, each estatesman was obliged
to plant a yew-tree by his homestead, in order
that he might never lack of wood for his bow
when he was called&mdash;as he not unfrequently
was called&mdash;to the Marches, in defence of the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P168"></a>168}</span>
Border.  And in many places, long after the
homestead has passed away, the solitary yew
survives to tell us of the troublous times of
old.  It was not long since an estatesman
sent down to the local museum of Keswick
the old oaken bow-chest of his fathers, which,
though it has been long used as a meal-ark,
by its carving clearly shows it was intended
for other use.  The family name of Bowman
is a common one in Cumberland, and still in
our neighbourhood the field-names preserve a
memory of the village bowman's prowess, and
the 'butts' field is a word of common parlance.
</p>

<p>
But it is George Fox, the man of peace,
that we were most interested in, as we crossed
the Keswick Valley and climbed the long
slope of Whinlatter to pay a visit to the
brave man's preaching place, and it was mere
coincidence that that preaching place should
be associated with weapons of war.

THE LORTON YEW.
</p>

<p>
People do not realise how fair a view of
the whole Skiddaw range is presented to them
as they climb that pass, or they would climb
it oftener.  The higher one climbs, the higher
does Skiddaw appear, and deep-bosomed
mountain-side in all its massy grandeur of
emerald green and lilac shade in spring, of
puce and burnished bronze in autumn,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P169"></a>169}</span>
impresses one with its calm and restfulness.
The cloud, sure sign of fine weather, rests
upon its utmost peak to-day, and irresistibly
recalls the lines of Wordsworth's sonnet:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Veiling itself in mid-Atlantic clouds<br>
  To pour forth streams more sweet than Castaly,'<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
while the pleasant farms with the far-off
interchange of happy cock-crowing, glitter at our
feet, and, like an arm of some great ocean-loch,
the white waters of Bassenthwaite come
round the precipice of Barf, and sweep out
of the shadow of Wythop woods into the
September sunshine.  On our left rises
Grasmoor, haunt of the dottrel, and Hobcarton
Crag, beloved of rare mountain flowers.  So
we crest the long slope and drop down into
Lorton, with the hill-sides on our right, golden
with gorse against the westering sun.  Turning
sharply to the left as soon as the village
is reached, we pass a kind of pleasant rural
street, if that may be called a street which
has houses only on the one side of it, and
just as we emerge into the country again,
find ourself at a spot where the road forks, a
portion of it going over a beck bridge into a
farm enclosure by a picturesque old water-mill
and byre, and a portion of it,&mdash;the main road
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P170"></a>170}</span>
to Loweswater,&mdash;bending sharply to the right
to go across the valley by the north side of
the stream, which is here hidden from view
by a long barn building.  If we pause at this
point we cannot help being struck by the
sombre mass of a great yew-tree standing in
a pleasant meadow close to the beck, where
at one time there was doubtless a ford.  This
is what Wordsworth described as
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A yew-tree, Pride of Lorton Vale,<br>
  Which to this day stands single, in the midst<br>
  Of its own darkness, as it stood of yore,<br>
  Not loth to furnish weapons for the bands<br>
  Of Umfraville or Percy ere they marched<br>
  To Scotland's heaths; or those that crossed the sea<br>
  And drew their sounding bows at Azincour,<br>
  Perhaps at earlier Crecy, or Poictiers.<br>
  Of vast circumference and gloom profound<br>
  This solitary tree!&mdash;a living thing<br>
  Produced too slowly ever to decay;<br>
  Of form and aspect too magnificent<br>
  To be destroyed.'<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
It is not to-day the noble tree it was when
Fox was here, and the prophecy of the poet
was only a few years since like to have been
made utterly vain.  For its form and aspect
was so magnificent that its owner sold it to a
Lorton wood merchant, and it was just about
to be cut down when some memory of Fox's
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P171"></a>171}</span>
sermon awoke in the breast of a faithful
member of the Society of Friends in the
neighbourhood, and the wood merchant
good-naturedly went off his bargain.
</p>

<p>
It is true that it shows no signs of decay,
but it has suffered loss.  Two of its main stems
were shattered years ago by a hurricane, and
were sawn off at the bole.  Let us go along
the road to the farm buildings, and turn back
down to what now serves for a watering-place
for horses.  It is thus we shall best get an
idea of how 'it stands single, in the midst of
its own darkness.'
</p>

<p>
The branches stretch their shadow over
the stream, and the ripple of the sunny
talkative beck contrasts strangely with the deep
silence of the solemn tree.  If we go up to
Whinfell Hall and ask a keen observer of
nature and plant life about this famous yew,
Mr. Wilson Robinson will tell us that he
once measured the trunk at its least
circumference and found it 23 feet 10 inches, and
that, about thirty years ago, a strong
south-east gale came with hurricane force down
Hope Ghyll, wrenched off one of the side
limbs and carried away a third of the tree.
Another limb has fallen since then, and yet,
shattered and torn, what a magnificent ruin it
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P172"></a>172}</span>
is, how well worth climbing over Whinlatter
Pass to visit.
</p>

<p>
After gazing up the beck towards the
picturesque bridge from which we first
surveyed the yew, towards the grand old
farmstead and its cluster of sycamores as a
background for the bridge, let us go back
to the bridge and across into the meadow
wherein the 'Pride of Lorton Vale' stands,
and, gazing from under the tree towards the
west and south, let us wonder at the beauty
of faintly bronzed fern on Whiteside, the
amethystine lilac of the Grasmoor mass, the
far-off cones of Red Pike and High Stile
blue above Mellbreak, and far to the west,
Herdhouse ghostly grey; all seeming to join
in shutting out the world and making the
quiet emerald meadow in which we stand a
sanctuary for thought and restfulness.
</p>

<p>
Then let us go back to that day in the
year 1653 when George Fox, having narrowly
escaped death by a boy's rapier thrust, and
with his hand and wrist still smarting from
the cruel blow of a rough fellow down at
Bootle, where they mobbed him on the
previous Sunday, pale and worn came hither
to the ford and found already James Lancaster,
one of his disciples, who had gone forward
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P173"></a>173}</span>
as an avant-courier on the way to Cockermouth,
busy haranguing the people.
</p>

<p>
The quiet meadow of to-day was on that
day full of armed men.  A detachment of
Cromwell's soldiers had been told off from
Cockermouth to keep the peace&mdash;it being
known that Fox was on his way to Lorton;
and Mr. Larkham, the Congregationalist
minister of Cockermouth, and Priest Wilkinson,
the Vicar of Brigham-cum-Mosser-cum-Lorton,
were probably among the crowd that
covered the field and stood by the banks of
the stream.  'The people,' we read in Fox's
<i>Journal</i>, 'lay up and down in the open, like
people at a leaguer.'  Fox had seen something
of camp life during the late civil war,
and he doubtless felt that day that, man of
peace though he was, the field of the Lorton
yew would be indeed a field of battle for him.
</p>

<p>
But what interests us most as we gaze
upon this venerable tree to-day in these
pleasant pastures beside the waters of peace,
is not so much the memory of the crowd of
Cromwellian soldiers and members of the
Church militant who came out that day to
'sorely withstand' George Fox, as the vision
of the boughs of this sable and majestic yew-tree
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P174"></a>174}</span>
filled with the listening ears and eager
eyes of those who heard that day the weary
and way-worn prophet of the Lord, 'largely
declare the word of Life' as he knew it,
and 'open the everlasting Gospel to them.'  Fox
tells us that 'this tree was so full of
people that I feared they would break it
down.'
</p>

<p>
Look at it now, and think of it no longer
as a broken yew-tree, sown here perchance by
some far wandering bird centuries ago, but
as a living witness to the power of men who
have a living Gospel to declare to win the
souls of their fellows, and lead them into
communion with God who is a spirit.  Men
once heard the voice of Fox sound out here,
above the babble of the beck and the hum
of the multitude and the protests of the
Lorton minister, and those who crowded on
the yew-tree boughs felt light instead of
darkness&mdash;sun instead of shadow, was their
portion, and we read, 'Many hundreds were
convinced that day, and received the Lord
Jesus Christ and His free teaching with
gladness.'
</p>

<p>
We are not Quakers, but at least our
hearts beat in unison with the earnest
teacher of the Truth he knew, to an age that
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P175"></a>175}</span>
was helped and is still helped by that Truth;
and as we leave the field of the tree,
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Not loth to furnish weapons for the bands<br>
  Of Umfraville or Percy ere they marched<br>
  To Scotland's heaths; or those that crossed the sea<br>
  And drew their sounding bows at Azincour,'<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
we rejoice to think that beneath its sable
boughs, the preacher of the way of peace as
better than war, once preached a sermon;
and we trust, that for many a long year still,
'single in the midst of its own darkness as
it stood of yore,' may stand the Lorton Yew.

<h3>
LODORE AFTER STORM.
</h3>

<p>
Five days of continual tempest and five nights
of storm-wind from the Atlantic had tried the
nerves and tempers and tested the sleeping
powers of all in the Keswick Vale.  Nothing
like wind to set folks 'fratching'; and that
anybody was still on speaking terms with his
neighbour argued well for the kindliness of
the townsmen and villagers.
</p>

<p>
At last it would seem as if the wind had
blown itself out, and at six o'clock of a grey
February evening silence and calm fell upon
the sodden, weary vale.  But an ominous
cloud-pack boiled up over the western hills, and
the barometer went down two inches.  The
cattle were scarcely 'suppered up' for the
night in the farmsteads and the shopmen
had scarcely clanged down their last shutter,
when the wind again awoke, and the hills
thundered and the trees groaned, and we
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P177"></a>177}</span>
knew that America had sent us another
cyclone.  The hail-showers thrashed the panes,
the windows rattled, the chimneys moaned
and sighed, and though tired men and women
went to bed, it was only to feel their
house-walls shake as if an earthquake shock were
passing underneath, and only to wonder which
would be the first chimney-stack to fall.  The
wind grew to a hurricane, and people as they
lay in sleepless fear upon their beds heard
strange voices in the storm&mdash;cries of sailors
in agony upon a bitter shore or perishing
in the deep.  Then the wind would be heard
to try all round the house and see if
perchance a window-frame would give an entrance
and indoor havoc be possible; or a slate
would whirl up with a crack and come down
clattering on the roof and spin off into the
darkness.
</p>

<p>
The dawn broke dimly, and the pastures of
the middle vale lay like a wan sea with
isles of emerald.  Broken boughs hung gaunt
and creaking upon the nearest trees, and the
Irish yews curtsied and danced and split
themselves into a hundred spires of nodding
darkness against the angry sky.  But the
hurricane, however much it might make man
cower and fear, had no power upon the thrush,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P178"></a>178}</span>
who saw, behind the hurricane light of
cheerless morn, the dawn of springtide and love
and calm.  No storm could
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Quell or disconcert her golden tongue,'<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
and there, while the wind fluffed her breast
to twice its size, she fluted from the swaying
holly tree her old familiar call to the slow
to 'be quick! be quick!' to the drowsy, to
'pray, get up! get up!' and then to the sad
to 'cheer up now! cheer up! cheer up!'
</p>

<p>
I answered her challenge and arose.  The
lake from end to end was ridded with foam,
and great clouds of water, torn from the
surface, were marching from west to east.
Borrodale was black with storm.  There was
no snow on Skiddaw, though the sleet had in
a night turned its fine old head grizzled grey,
but over Grasmoor and over Grisedale it
seemed as if some huge ocean wave had
broken and left its froth behind it.
</p>

<p>
Nearer, however, than on Grasmoor and
on Grisedale there was snow.  Far down
beyond the purpling 'Walla' woodland, lay, in
a crevice of the hills between Gowder Crag
and Shepherd's Crag, a mighty drift of
seeming winter whiteness.  That was no gift of
winter; it was the gift of the past night's
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P179"></a>179}</span>
rain.  Gazing at it through a good field-glass
one could see that the white drift was a
falling torrent, and as one gazed one almost,
in fancy, heard
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'the roar<br>
  That stuns the tremulous cliffs of high Lodore.'<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
I knew that they only can see Lodore aright
who will brave storm and tempest, for so
swiftly does this splendid cataract pour itself
away that an hour after the rains have ceased
upon the Watendlath fells it dwindles to its
natural size, loses its milk-white charm, and
ceases to summon the wanderer to its presence.
But this morning its spell was potent to touch
all hearts, and that white winter wreath of
snow and sound called us from far away.
Down by the old monks' path we went, that
the hoofs of sumpter-mules in the Middle
Ages had worn deep into the soft soil;&mdash;it
was to-day a torrent-bed of bubbling water.
On by the village school, where, instead of
the pattering of children's clogs upon the
doorstep, to-day the Greta's water gushed
and fell in miniature cascade.  Over the
bridge beneath Greta Hall, on which the
pencil-makers hung in enforced idleness, for
there was too much water to allow the use
of the millwheel.  'Brig is pinched to be
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P180"></a>180}</span>
large eneuf for t' watter to-day,' they cried;
and so to the town.  'Dar bon! but thoo
bed better keep to lee-side oop street&mdash;-slates
is fleein' same as leaves i' winter,' said an
old friend as he passed me.  'Well, Betty,
what such a night have you had?' I said to
another old friend at the street corner.
'Loavins me!' she answered, 'but it's been
a capper.  Cwoal cart was lifted up and clean
turned ower befoar my eyes in oor back
yard; and I've been up and dressed sin five
this morn.  What I thowt wi' mysel if
anything's goin' to happen, it 'ull not dea fur us
<i>all</i> to be naked, and sea I got intil my cleas!'
</p>

<p>
So up the main street&mdash;powdered with
broken slates and plaster from the house
fronts, and out into the Borrodale road we
went.  Trees were laid by their heels at the
church gate, the holly berries gleamed in
thousands by the roadside; the wind had
done what in this open winter the birds
had failed to do.  Thence on to the Great
Wood.  Fine spruces lay across the road,
and the roadmen and woodcutters were busy
making passage possible for the cart traffic.
Such a scent of Christmas trees they made
as they hewed away at the spruce branches
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P181"></a>181}</span>
one felt oneself a child again, and so with
a child's heart forward.  All through the
purple woodland were white patches in
top-most boughs, the wounds that the fierce
wind had given them.  Only one thing the
tempest had been powerless to touch; these
were the tender lichens and the velvet mosses
on trunk and wall.  How they gleamed and
shone in the forest twilight!  And whilst the
boughs clashed and the wood was filled with
groans and shrieks and cries, there, by the
wall and on the ground and on the tree-stems,
in quiet restfulness and silent beauty
the fearless mosses grew.
</p>

<p>
But this was not all the gentle life that
seemed to fear no storm, for quavering along
from bough to bough a school of long-tailed
titmice went in unalarmed pleasure.  The wind
that shook the oak seemed unable to touch
them, and down beside me the tiny wren
played his old happy game of hide-and-seek,
as if, instead of being lashed by a cyclone,
the woods were still as eventide in June.
</p>

<p>
Cat Ghyll, beloved of Southey, roared at us
as we passed, and one heard the wind like a
trumpet blowing from the steep of Falcon Crag.
</p>

<p>
Now clear view was gained of Derwentwater,
and one noted that the lake lay in long
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P182"></a>182}</span>
patches of many colours, here bright green,
there slate blue, there brown, here white and
wan, but ridged throughout with foam; and
suddenly, as if it sprang upward from hidden
depths, a water wraith would leap to sight
and other spirits would join it, and the whole
silver company of ghostlike vaporous forms
would come dancing across from the further
shore and lose themselves in cloud-like dust
upon the land.  Or here again would rise a
tiny waterspout and spin and spin the water
up into mid-air, then march and counter-march,
lie down, and rise again.  While all the time
upon the shore beneath the roadway, waves
broke and surge tumbled, with moaning of a
troubled sea that might not rest.  It was
something in such a whirl of sound and hissing of
such restless waters to feel far up on the other
hand, above the russet grey-green draperies
and the lilac shales, the calm of the
storm-proof citadel of Falcon Crag.  We gained
Barrow, and heard the waterfall bellowing in
the wood; but it was Lodore that we had
set out to see, and Lodore shone white and
clear upon its steep only half-a-mile away.
</p>

<p>
Full sight of Lodore had now been gained,
but not before two other cataracts flashing to
one channel from Gowder Crag had claimed
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P183"></a>183}</span>
our wonder, while we watched the water fall, as
it seemed, out of heaven, down by the silver
birches, down by the silver shale, and turn
both to darkness by its white contrast.  But
what a magnificent rose-red glow those birch
trees showed, and how with auburn glory the
larches gleamed! how too in silken grey and
delicate yellow the ash trees climbed the crags!
We went forward, but not till we had noted
that, while all the world towards Grange
seemed one great grey water-flood, here right
in front of the purple-brown cliff in whose
cleft lay the white Lodore, stood up a little
meadowy hill of verdure green as May&mdash;the
first home-field of the wandering Viking who
pushed his long ship ashore at Ravenglass and
made his way over the Styhead Pass to
ancient Borrodale.  For in this green field
still flows the spring where Ketel the Viking,
who afterwards gave his name to the Wyke
which we call Keswick to-day, drank in the
olden time.  Ketel's Well, as we gaze upon
that emerald mound, takes us back to the
ninth century and the first coming of the
Norsemen to our dales; and what was it that
bade the hardy Norse rover choose to pitch
his camp by the spring on yonder hill but
that same glorious cataract of Lodore, whose
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P184"></a>184}</span>
gleaming waters and whose voice of thunder
speaks to our heart as it one time spoke to
his.  Nay, for that weary wanderer over sea,
Lodore spoke sweeter things.  As he listened to
the torrent's voice, there came back memories
of his own home-land and all the sound and
sight of those fair 'fosses' and those shining
'ghylls' from which he was an outlawed exile.

LODORE AFTER A STORM.
</p>

<p>
We pass on beyond the hollies, beyond the
amber reed-bed, beyond the grey copse, and
gain the gate to the Fall.  We cross the
meadow and enter the wood and stand upon
the little platform whence the Fall in its
fulness may be seen.  What strikes one at once
is the majesty of the high-towering crag of
Gowder to the left of Lodore.  What strikes
one next, is the feeling of a certain lack of
height in the fall.  It does not come rushing
over a sheer precipice; it is not cloud-born;
one seems to know that somewhere not far off
a valley stream is passing along through quiet
meadows and woodland, and something of the
fierce wildness of its fall is curbed and tamed
by the thought.  Yet as we gaze to-day so
white is the heaven in the rift between the
cliffs whence it surges into sight, that a very
little imagination enables us to feel as if the
whole of that white interspace were foam, and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P185"></a>185}</span>
one's heart is stirred.  Not in a rift, but from
the topmost height we think we see and hear
a visionary cataract fall and fall.
</p>

<p>
Up now through broken boulders, wet with
perpetual mist, slippery with sodden leaf of
russet gold, up till a double wych elm, or
two elms bound in sisterly embrace&mdash;as if they
had in fear clutched one another as they stood
in awe upon the torrent's brink, is gained;
there in shelter of a huge rock, emerald-coated,
silver-shining with the spray, we shelter from
the drenching water-dust and see another view
of glorious Lodore.  See and hear, for while
the milk-white waters flash and swirl around
the ebon boulders in mid-fall, we hear the tall
upstanding cliffs make echo to their voice&mdash;such
sound as he who hears can never quite
forget.  We climb again up by a slippery path
only fit for a goat's foot, helped by impending
branches, helped more by the thought that
yonder one will gain not only the noblest view
of the waterfall, but a far outlook over the
wide-watered vale to grey-blue western hills,
beyond which booms the sea that gave us, on
the wings of the wind, all this majesty of sound
and motion.
</p>

<p>
In this hurricane, the salt of that ocean is
on one's lips, and if its actual murmurs and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P186"></a>186}</span>
the 'scents of the infinite sea' are denied us,
at least by proxy they are ours.  For as we
slowly win our way upward the scent of
Lodore fills the air, even as its sound fills our
ears.  Not the kind of paper-mill scent one
knows so well within the locks or by the
backwaters of the Thames, but scent born of
mountain springs and fellside tarns and peaty
meadows&mdash;scents as delicate as they are subtle.
</p>

<p>
We have gained our vantage point for sight
and sound.  The huge rocks appear like
leviathans bobbing their noses through the foam.
A tree trunk has fallen, and seems to have
been caught and held by the mouth of some
vast hippopotamus, who rejoices as the torrent
dashes over his vast back.  And the sound is
not of bellowing behemoth or snorting
river-horse.  No; but such sound as seems to bring
all worlds to unison.  Shut your eyes, lean,
and listen; you may hear a mighty army
tramping by, you may hear the clashing of
innumerable bells, you may hear the blare of
trumpets, you may hear the shouting of a festal
multitude, and ever beneath the deepest
harmonies the tattoo of the thundering river-god,
the drum-drum-drumming of Lodore.
</p>

<p>
One cannot wonder that hither in 1802
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P187"></a>187}</span>
came Charles Lamb, the lover of the city's
roar, to listen and rejoice.  Keats, too, in
1816 came hither and went, as Lamb went
back, a sadder and a wetter man; but it is
of Southey and his two children, his Edith
May and his darling Herbert, we think
to-day&mdash;he who in the autumn of 1809 heard
the same stream saying the same things it
says to us to-day, and who writing to his
brother Tom on board the <i>Dreadnought</i> under
date October 18, 1809, said:
</p>

<p>
'I hope you will approve of a description
of the water of Lodore made originally for
Edith and greatly admired by Herbert.  In
my mind it surpasses any that the tourists
have yet printed.  Thus it runs: "Tell the
people how the water comes down at Lodore?
Why, it comes thundering and floundering,
and thumping and bumping, and jumping,
and hissing and whizzing, and dripping and
skipping, and grumbling and rumbling and
tumbling and falling and brawling, and
dashing and clashing and splashing and pouring
and roaring, and whirling and curling, and
leaping and creeping, and sounding and
bounding, and chattering and clattering with
a dreadful uproar&mdash;and that way the water
comes down at Lodore."'
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P188"></a>188}</span>
</p>

<p>
We turned for home; a patch of blue sky
shone momentarily above the purple hollow
of sound and foam.  And though still 'the
forest cracked, the waters curled,' a sunbeam
showered radiance as it flew by moaning
woodland and by silent crag.  In the Great
Wood all colours of purple, amber, rose, and
amethyst leapt out at the passing of that
gleam.  One could not but compare the
marvellous and changeful effects of light and
colour to those that, in some enchanted land
of mystery, the coloured fires of the wizard of
the pantomime call forth, for our children's
amazement.
</p>

<p>
Now all near was dark, while far ahead
the witchery of the golden woodland grew.
Now Walla Crag stood purple grey, now
shone in lucent silver powdered with larch-tree
gold, whilst ever on beyond the woody
lane, Skiddaw, as blue as solid cobalt, rose
calmly up into a wandering storm-white sky.
And yet for all this witchery of colour, for
all this magic transformation scene, one vision
stayed&mdash;that far-off wreath of quiet snow,&mdash;snow
that had turned on nearer view to scent
and sound, to life and light and laughter, to
power and impassioned loveliness, there in
the resonant chasm of Lodore.

</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P191"></a>191}</span>
</p>

<p>
We were standing by the Druid's Circle on
Castrigg Fell, and as the old yeoman spoke
to me I looked across the valley to the great
buttressed height of Blencathra&mdash;blacker to-day
beneath, by reason of the slight snow
covering on its summit, and saw in its grove
of larches the white house, half-farm,
half-mansion, whence the oldest Master of the
Hunt, in Britain, had gone for his far journey.
Never again would the men who follow the
hounds pass through the gate of the Riddings,
with the fox and the hound carved in stone
on either side of them, to be met and to be
greeted by the cheery old Squire on hunting
days; never again, after a long day's hunt,
would they repair to the Farrier Inn or to
the Salutation Inn, mid-village, to wait the
coming of the Master 'ere they all 'howked
in' to the 'tatie-pot' he had provided them.
</p>

<p>
There was a time when all the farmhouses
for miles round, and every cottage home, was
glad, because a Threlkeld man had come to
his own again, and I could not help contrasting
the gladness of that day, as told us by
Wordsworth in his <i>Feast of Brougham Castle</i>,
and <i>Song of the Shepherd Lord</i>, with the
sadness of this day for all the country side,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P192"></a>192}</span>
now that another shepherd-lord had gone unto
his own.  That shepherd-lord we read
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Was honoured more and more,<br>
  And ages after he was laid in earth<br>
  "The good Lord Clifford" was the name he bore.'<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
They were very different men, that shepherd-lord
and this our friend, the Master of the
Blencathra Hunt, John Crozier: but both of
them had been reared in the same quiet
pastoral scene, and among the same fine race
of shepherd gentlemen.  Both had learned
the lesson of this mountain side,&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Love had they found in huts where poor men lie,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their daily teachers had been woods and hills,<br>
  The silence that is in the starry sky,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sleep that is among the lonely hills.'<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Both men had won the hearts of the simple
people far and near, and ages after he is laid
in earth, as he will be laid by the side of
his beloved wife, in the Threlkeld Churchyard,
men will speak of 't'ald Squire,' and
enthusiastically tell of his hunting feats,
and remember how he loved his native
village.
</p>

<p>
The love of hunting which John Crozier
inherited from his father, who lived at Gate
Ghyll Farm on Blencathra's side, and who
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P193"></a>193}</span>
turned over to his son the mastership of what
were then spoken of as 'the Threlkeld dogs'
in the year 1840, is a passion with our dales'
folk which only those who live amongst them
can understand.
</p>

<p>
The 'varmint' is the natural enemy of the
shepherd, and this adds zest to the day's
sport.  In our churchwardens' accounts of old
time there appears the item 'A fox head,
21s.,' and though in other chapelries
3s. 4d. appears to have been the price paid, such a
scourge must Reynard have become that the
churchwardens felt they were justified in giving
a whole week's wage for the destruction of
one fox.  Down at Shoulthwaite and, for
aught I know, in other dales a fox trap of
masonry existed till of late years, built
beehive fashion with a hole in the top.  If
Reynard ventured in to the bait, which was a
fine fat hen, he was a prisoner; try to scale
the walls how he might the artful one was
foiled; but to trap a fox goes against the
grain.  There are certain things in which our
hunt differs from others.  Class distinctions
are unknown in the field.  The Master of the
Hunt knows all by their Christian name.  It
is a social gathering from daylight to dark.
The luxury of horses, too, is unknown.  The
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P194"></a>194}</span>
field are all running huntsmen of the type
of old Timothy, of whom Wordsworth wrote,
in the year 1800&mdash;the childless Timothy who
took up his staff, and with the thought of his
last child's death heavy upon him could
nevertheless not refuse the invitation of 'the horn
and the hark! hark-away,' and 'went to the
chase with a tear on his cheek.'
</p>

<p>
On that day when 'Skiddaw was glad with
the cry of the hounds,' old Timothy's daughter
Ellen had been dead five months or more, or
he probably would not have followed the hunt,
for there is a kind of etiquette that the hunters
in the dales observe, and they would no more
go a-hunting within a month after the death
of their beloved, than they would miss going
to church on the Sunday following the
funeral.  I remember once being asked by a
widower, who was in great sorrow and could
not get away from his thoughts, whether he
should take what he knew to be the best
physic&mdash;a day with the dogs.  I asked, 'What
would your wife have said?'  His answer
came quite straight: 'She wad hev clapped
a bit o' lunch in my pocket, gi'en me ma
staff, shut door upon me, and telt me not to
show my feace until supper time.'  I answered,
'That's enough,' and the man was a new
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P195"></a>195}</span>
being when he returned from the hunt, more
able to wrestle with his sorrows.
</p>

<p>
The women folk are as keen as their
husbands.  They tell of a 'woman body' at
Wythburn who, joining the hounds in full
cry, and finding her skirts in the way, stopped,
took a knife out of her pocket, and slit her
petticoat in order that with a 'divided skirt'
she might the surer be in at the kill.  How
keen the men are, is shown by the fact that
beginning as youngsters to follow the drag,
and carrying on a love of the sport through
the prime of manhood, they may be still found
from 75 to 80 and over, out with the hounds
at the call of the horn.  Nay, even when
their sight fails them, they will follow, and it
is on record that a veteran whose eyes were
failing him and who had the rare good luck
of a vantage ground to see the finish of the
hunt, and was so maddened by the hurried
and eager account from his companions of
how the hunt was going, that he cried out
'Hang thur aid een o' mine!  I wish that
they wer nobbut out all togidder; I believe I
wad see better through t' hooals!'
</p>

<p>
Fox hunting in the Lake Country tests the
sportsman.  None but a true lover of the
chase would be content to breakfast and get
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P196"></a>196}</span>
away with the stars (as in winter he
oft-times has to do that he may get to the
heights before the hounds are loosed)&mdash;and,
facing all weathers, come back with the stars.
He has to battle with storm and tempest.  It
may be fine in one valley and a roaring
blizzard on the other side of the mountain.
The old veteran, John Crozier, himself would
tell of how he had to lie down on Skiddaw
summit in a sudden and blinding snowstorm,
and on more than one occasion he and all
the hunt have suddenly been enveloped in a
thick mist, which made movement almost
impossible.  And hunting not only tries the
heart, it tries the head.  A fox gets 'binked,'
as they call it, or banked, and some one must
go up on an almost inaccessible crag to put
in the terrier; and a man must know the
country, and the probable run of every fox
that gets up in front of the hounds.  There
is no earth stopping; only the bields are
known, and the cunning of Reynard is a
secret, to be learnt not only by the huntsman
and whip but by every single man in the
field.  As for the foxes, though the old
greyhound breed that John Peel knew&mdash;20 lbs. to
29 lbs. in weight&mdash;have passed away, the little
black-legged Irish fox can give a good account
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P197"></a>197}</span>
of himself, and from three to five hours and
from 25 to 40 miles have not been an uncommon
experience of a run.
</p>

<p>
At the beginning of last century it was not
an unusual thing for the hounds to be
running 'on the tops' through the night,
and the legends of the 'whish-hounds,' or
'spirit-packs' of Cornwall and Devon might
very well have been reborn in Borrowdale.
</p>

<p>
In 1858 took place one of the record runs
of the Blencathra pack.  The dogs had had
already a good morning's work when at noon a
big Skiddaw fox jumped up in front of them.
He tried to shake off his pursuers by the
ordinary hill tactics, but, failing, took to the
valley, went by Crosthwaite Church, through
Portinscale and Brandelhow, right up Borrowdale,
and over the Styhead into Westmoreland.
The night fell, but the dogs were heard at Black
Hill, marking the fox at an earth.  Thence
Reynard escaped in the direction of Lancashire,
and next day the hounds and the fox
were found, the latter dead and the former fast
asleep under a crag in Coniston.  They must
have travelled not far short of sixty miles over
the very roughest part of the Lake Country.
</p>

<p>
The hounds are trained carefully not to
break up their foxes, just as they are trained
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P198"></a>198}</span>
as carefully not to worry sheep; and this
latter is done by the farmers walking the
dogs in the summer time and taking them,
along with their collies, when they go
shepherding on the fells.
</p>

<p>
The packs are small, but every hound is
true as steel.  The Blencathra huntsman
generally unkennels about 11 couples, and so keen
are they at their work that three years ago
they gave an account of 76 foxes, last year
of 46, and this year, up to date, of 43.  But
the cost of keeping the pack is very small.
£200 clears all expenses, and this is partly
accounted for by the kindly interest farmers,
who are all members of the hunt, take in it,
for they walk the dogs free of charge, and
some of them are, in addition, subscribers.  Very
anxious are these men, too, to do their best
by the dogs.  The hounds are made members
of the family, and their tempers and
individualities are studied.  A farmer would take
it very ill if he did not have the same hound
sent him at the end of the hunting season.
This reacts by making a bond of enthusiastic
interest for members of the field in the
running of every dog.
</p>

<p>
Nor can we omit to mention the sense of
brotherhood which binds the hunt together.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P199"></a>199}</span>
As there is no separation of class, so there is
no separation of dress; no buttonholes and
fine leather boots.  The hunting kit is but a
flannel shirt, a pair of trousers rolled up to
the knee, over a pair of stout woollen hose, a
Tam o' Shanter, and a rough alpenstock.  The
poorest can afford that, and the richest know
no better.
</p>

<p>
Another bond that unites the members of
the Blencathra Hunt is the home-made hunting
songs which are sung at the end of the
day.  There is one written by a Patterdale
yeoman, which has a good ring in it:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Now who could help but follow when notes as sweet as these<br>
  Are sounding through the valley and borne upon the breeze?<br>
  Of all the recreations by which our lives are blest,<br>
  The chase among the mountains is the purest and the best.'<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
And there is another favourite written by
Harper, one of the roadmen in the neighbourhood;
while Woodcock Graves' immortal ditty,
'D'ye ken John Peel?' is never better sung
than at the annual dinner of the Blencathra
Hunt.
</p>

<p>
I am standing at the Druids' Circle and
looking across at Naddle.  In the hollow of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P200"></a>200}</span>
the ridge is the school of S. John's-in-the-Vale.
I remember that the old Squire, John Crozier,
got his first learning at that school; and that
some years after a poet of more than local
fame, John Richardson, became its schoolmaster.
He, too, immortalised the Blencathra
Hunt, and one of his best songs will, for many
years to come, echo the 'tally-ho!' of the late
Master of the Hunt:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'The hunt is up, the hunt is up;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Auld Tolly's in the drag;<br>
  Hark to him, beauties, git away,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He's gone for Skiddaw Crag.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rise fra ye'r beds, ye sleepy-heads,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If ye wad plesser know;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye'r hearts 't will cheer, if ye bit hear<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John Crozier's "Tally-ho!"'<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
That last line calls us back to the man who
has carried on, to a century's ending, the
Mastership of the pack his father gave him in
charge.

A NORTH COUNTRY NIMROD.
</p>

<p>
As a lad of 18, John Crozier was already
well known as a keen sportsman, as good
with his rod in the becks and rivers here
about, as he was with his father's hounds, and
fond of wrestling as he was of hunting.  At
that day the pack numbered only six couples.
They were kept at the farms all through the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P201"></a>201}</span>
year, and were trained to meet at the sound
of the Master's horn.  The old Squire would
often tell how he would stand on Kiln Hill,
blow a blast, and watch the beauties racing
across the meadows to his call.  John Peel,
in those days, was still hunting on the other
side of Skiddaw, and John Crozier remembered
the last time he saw him was under
Wanthwaite Crags, where, after a long day's
run, he invited the old veteran, who was on
his white pony, to come home to supper.
'Nay, nay, John,' said Peel, 'I'se freetened
o' gettin' neeted (benighted),' and so went
back on his way to Ruthwaite supperless.
'But I'll see thee again,' he added&mdash;who
knows they may again have met.
</p>

<p>
The first thing the young Master did was to
improve the breed of his hounds, and this he
accomplished by getting a strain from John
Peel's kennels.  How much of Ruby, 'Ranter,
Royal, and Bellman, so true,' spoken of in
the song, still runs in the blood of the
Blencathra pack, I know not.  Other strains since
then have been introduced, but a hardier pack
never breasted a mountain side, and there is
not one of them who would not carry on
the line himself, if his fellows failed, to the
death.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P202"></a>202}</span>
</p>

<p>
John Crozier once received the following
note: 'To J. Crozier, Esq., M.F.H., from
Isaac and Edward Brownrigg, of Brownrigg.
This hound (Darling) brought a splendid dog-fox,
and after a very exciting hunt ultimately
caught it in our house field.  About an hour
afterwards other five dogs came.  After being
fed they left, but this one would not leave.
We intend having the fox preserved.'  After
carrying on the hounds at his own cost
for 30 years, 'the Squire,' as he was always
called, at the request of his neighbours, allowed
them to become a subscription pack, in the
year 1870.  There was a general feeling in
the dales that it was not fair to allow all the
burden to be upon one man, and on the
conditions that he would remain Master, and in
case of the hunt ceasing, the hounds should
be returned to him.  A treasurer and secretary
were appointed, and the Blencathra Hunt went
on merrily as before.
</p>

<p>
The Master was fortunate in his huntsmen.
Joseph Fearon, of honoured memory, was
succeeded by Isaac Todhunter, who carried the
horn for 25 years.  Isaac Todhunter handed
it on to John Porter, who for a like time
kept up the best traditions of the pack, which
Jem Dalton carries on to-day.  The names of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P203"></a>203}</span>
these past huntsmen, with other members of
the hunt, are inscribed on the stone of memorial
raised in the Threlkeld Churchyard at the
charges of the Squire and a few friends; and
that pillar in the King's dale&mdash;for of this
dale John Crozier was truly king&mdash;if it does
nothing else, goes to prove that the following
of the foxes in the Lake District adds years,
even as it adds cheer, to the lives of the
dalesmen.  Thus, for example, one sees that many
of the hunters were fourscore years before
they were run to earth; one was 89, another
91, another 95, and a fourth 98.
</p>

<p>
Up till the past two years the old Master
of the hunt presided at the annual hunt dinner,
but it was known that his health was failing,
and though each week up to the end he kept
in touch with all the doings of his pack, he
did not leave his house.  Still week by week
members of the hunt would go up and have a
'crack' with him&mdash;always to be received with
the same courteous inquiry, 'Well, how about
your wives and families, are they well?  That's
right.  Is any news stirring?  What about
the House last night?'  He took the keenest
interest in politics up to the end, and that came,
not unexpectedly, at two o'clock on a quiet
starlit morning, Thursday, 5th March, 1903.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P204"></a>204}</span>
</p>

<p>
I could not wonder that my old friend the
yeoman had said it was a dark day for
Threlkeld, for he had lived among his own people,
and loved them to the end.  How they loved
him may be gathered from the fact that two
days before he died, a casket containing a
book in which every householder in the parish
had entered his name, with an illuminated
address, full of affection and gratitude, for
the friendship towards them of a long life,
was brought to the house.  'Ya kna,' said
my friend, 'they knew t' aid Squire was
house-fast, and they likely thowt 't wad cheer 'im
up a laal bit.'  He never saw it, for it was
thought he was too ill to be 'fashed' with
it, and he is beyond all earthly cheering now;
'the Hunter is home from the Hill.'
</p>

<p>
On the following Monday there was such a
gathering together of the dalesmen from far
and near as had never been seen in Threlkeld
Church, or Threlkeld Churchyard.  They
sang one of the old Squire's favourite hymns.
They bore the coffin to the grave with the
veteran's hunting cap and crop and the brush
of the last fox killed by his pack upon it, and
before and after the service they talked of
him kindly, as Cumberland folk ever do of the
dead; they spoke of him, not only as the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P205"></a>205}</span>
oldest Master of Foxhounds in the land, but
as a man who entered into all the social
enjoyments of the country-side, and whilst
on terms of close intimacy, almost familiarity,
with the companions, retained their regard,
and in some things set them a good example.
</p>

<p>
For in an age when the gambling spirit was
abroad, it will be remembered that John
Crozier never bet a penny in his life.  'I did
yance think o' betting a hawpeth o' snaps,'
he once said in the vernacular; 'but I kind
of considered it ower, and I didn't.'  It will
be remembered of him, too, that he was
against the use of bad language in the field,
and that he never would allow, if he could
help it, a bit of scandal or 'ill gien gossip.'  If
he heard one man running down another or
passing an unkind judgment, or setting an
unkind tale 'agate,' he would jerk out, 'There,
noo, thoo mun let that hare sit'&mdash;and it sat.
'Ay, ay,' said an old friend as he turned away
from the graveyard, 'tho' he said nowt about
it, he was a kind o' a religious man, was varra
partial to certain hymns, and had his favourite
psalms, that he wad gang off quietly to his
bit summerhoose most mornings, and tek his
prayer book with him.  They say t' housekeeper,
after her master's death, found t' aid
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P206"></a>206}</span>
beuk laid open on summerhoose taable, I
suppose.'
</p>

<p>
But as they left the churchyard they all in
memory saw the old Master in his sealskin cap,
with the lappets about his ears&mdash;squarely built
and strong, with his alpenstock in hand, as the
prefatory verse tells:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I think I see him stand,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rough mountain staff in hand,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fur cap and coat of grey,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a smile for all the band<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the sportsmen in the land,<br>
  And a word for all the merry men who loved his 'Hark away!'
</p>

<p class="noindent">
And as they thought of what he has been to
them for the last 65 years in the Threlkeld
vale, they admitted the truth of the following
words:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last hunter of your race!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we bear you to your place,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We forget the hounds and horn,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the tears are on our face,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For we mind your deeds of grace,<br>
  Loving-kindness, late and early, unto all the village-born.<br>
</p>

<h3>
A WINTER-DAY ON DERWENTWATER.
</h3>

<p>
If November is the month for cloud effect,
December certainly is the month for marvellous
dawns and eventides.  Then it would
appear as if by some generous intent to give
the minds of men unwonted tranquillity and to
impress all the dwellers in the vales with
the thought of perfect restfulness, the sun
seems to prepare for his rising a heaven of
cloudless silver washed with faintest gold.
All the heavy ragged companies of the
night-wrack seem withdrawn, and very slowly, while
Helvellyn stands lilac-grey against the silver
dawn, the sun rolls into sight, kindles the
cones of Grisedale and Grasmoor, and bids
the heavy dew upon the valley meadows rise
up in finest lines of delicate gossamer lawn.
</p>

<p>
Yesterday, though we had little wind in the
valley, one could hear the humming and the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P208"></a>208}</span>
roaring of what seemed a tempest in middle
heaven, but at night-time heaven and earth
were still, and the seven stars in Orion and
the Pleiads, 'like fireflies tangled in a silver
braid,' shone clear, and we felt that the Frost
King had come in earnest.  There was no
snow on the hills this morning; the leaves at
one's feet tinkled as though they were made
of iron; I met schoolboys with rosy faces and
skates upon their shoulders going off to Tewfit
Tarn&mdash;the little tarn upon the ridge dividing
Naddle from St. John's in the Vale, that
always gives our skaters in the Keswick
neighbourhood their first winter happiness.
Down to the lake I went, and standing at
Friar's Crag, saw that part of it was burnished
steel and part black ebon water.  It was
incredible that one night's frost should thus have
partly sealed the lake from sight.

<br>
A WINTER'S DAY ON DERWENTWATER.
</p>

<p>
I was bound for Brandelhow to meet the
woodman to discuss the felling of certain
timber, and through the ice pack, if it were
possible, I must needs go.  Coasting along
round the island, I soon found myself in a
narrow inlet of water that stretched half across
the lake; tiny spikules of ice that seemed like
floating straws were right and left of me in
the still water; here and there little delicate
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P209"></a>209}</span>
fans of ice were passed.  These miniature
ice-islands were the nuclei round which the
freezing mixture would crystallise.  Forward across
towards Lingholme I steered, and suddenly
should have been brought up sharp had not
the boat, with good way upon it, crashed
right into the ice-floe and shown me how
unsubstantial a thing this first ice-covering of
the lake was.  With every stroke of the oar
the boat forged its way with marvellous sound
of crash and gride, and one remembered how
the Ancient Mariner had heard those 'noises
in a swound,' and was able to summon up
something of the roar with which the great
ice-breakers or steam rams on the Neva crash
their way up and down the river to keep the
waterway clear for the Baltic shipping.  But
in a short time the difficulty of rowing became
doubled, and if it had not been that one saw
clear water ahead one would hardly have
ventured forward.  Meanwhile in the wake of
one's boat one saw how swiftly the little
ice-elves repaired the damage one had done by
bringing back to its own place and rest each
fragment one had displaced, and piecing over
with exquisite exactness the breach that one had made.
</p>

<p>
Now the way was clear, for by some
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P210"></a>210}</span>
mysterious reason, known only to the
water-gods, the shallower the water became as one
went shoreward the freer it was of ice.  It
may have been mere fantasy, but it seemed
as if the water so near to freezing was
semi-fluid, viscous; always right and left of one
swam by the little ice spikules, and the ice
fans, with irridescent beauty, floated and shone
hard by.  Presently another crash was heard,
and an ice-belt, only a yard wide, but stretching
fifty or sixty yards along, was crashed
through, another and another, and so, with
alternate noise and silence, one made one's
way to Victoria Point, and ran the boat
ashore at Brandelhow.
</p>

<p>
Beautiful as that woodland is in early
spring, it seemed that to-day there were more
beauties still.  The bracken was silver-dusted
with frost and shone gold in the sunshine, and
the green velvet of the mosses upon tree-trunk
and ground only heightened by contrast
the rich russet of the fern.  I climbed to the
russet seat on the rocky knoll above; there,
sitting, I watched the gambolling of five
squirrels and listened to the crackling as their
sharp teeth made short work of the cones and
fir-tufts.  All these little merry feasters had
put on their winter coats, and were much less
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P211"></a>211}</span>
red of hue than when I watched them last in
August.  They had put on their winter tails
also.  I saw none of that curious white flaxen
colour which the squirrel in September seems
so proud of, as, with a wave of his brush, he
dashes out of sight.  There, as I watched
these miracles of motion and alertness, I
thought of Ruskin&mdash;how lovingly he had
described them.  Here was one leaping on to
a twig that bent with just enough of swing
in it to allow the little fellow to fly through
the air to the next bough.  Here was another,
now running along the sturdier bough that
bent not, now dropping five or six feet into
a dark-green tuft, now sitting cosily in a
forked branch to munch his midday meal,
now racing for pure joy and mischief after
his brother up a long tree-trunk, the tail
sometimes bent in an arch above the tufted
ears, again thrown out straight, and now bent
and undulating&mdash;truly a balancing-pole, if ever
one was needed by such expert gymnasts.
Children of perfect knowledge of the woodland
boughs, fearless as birds and swift as
monkeys, the happy family rejoiced in the
winter sunshine, as free of care as the
cloudless sky above their heads.  I moved, and
the jay clanged and screamed from among
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P212"></a>212}</span>
the alders below me, and in a moment the
happy family had vanished out of sight, and
one saw what an intercommunion of alarm
against strange comers birds and beasts must
surely have.  Dropping down from this happy
mount&mdash;and truly it has been called Mons
Beata&mdash;I made my way through crackling
fern across the chattering little brooklet to
the second rocky height further to the
southward.  Blencathra lilac-grey and Walla Wood
purple-brown and High Seat tawny yellow
were reflected with such fidelity in the flood
below one that the beauty of two worlds
seemed to be given me.  The tranquillity of
the far-away fells was brought right across
the flood to one's feet, a couple of wild duck
dashed into the water, and with the ripplings
of their sudden descent they set the whole
fellside trembling.  Looking now towards Cat
Bels, one marvelled at the extraordinary
beauty of the colour.  Never was such bronze
and gold seen to make the sky so blue, as
one gazed up to the hummock of Cat Bels;
whilst, between our rustic seat and the high
road, the woodland hollow was filled with
colour of gradation from silver-grey to
purple-brown, and here and there a beech tree full
of leaf or a Scotch fir green and blue gave
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P213"></a>213}</span>
emphasis to the general tone of softest
harmony.  Passing on through the larches upon
the little height, I gained a third seat, and
here the chief charm was the outlook up
Borrodale.  Immediately in the foreground
were young Scotch fir; beyond them the lake
glinted in silver through leafless birches.
Away up Borrodale, with every variety of
lilac melting into purple-grey, ridge beyond
ridge, one saw the bossy outliers of the
Borrodale ranges stand up in sunny calm;
one felt the deep tranquillity of Glaramara
and of nearer Honister, the only sound a
distant cockcrow from the far-off Ashness
farm and the quiet inland murmur of Lodore.
The glory of the vale was the wonderful
Castle Hill, with its echo of old Rome upon
its head, that stood black-purple against the
further lilac haze.  But as one sat there in
silent content a school of long-tailed tits came
quavering by.  They found abundant food, it
would seem, in the Scotch firs close beside
me, and what the squirrels had done before
to open one's eyes to their miracle of movement
these long-tailed titmice did again, for
one here, as I sat and watched their happy
quest for food.  Such balancing, such joyousness,
such fiery energy, such swiftness of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P214"></a>214}</span>
sight, such whispering of heart's content would
have made the saddest man glad and the
dullest marvel.  As I rose from that seat,
with a long look up Borrodale, I could not
wonder that our Viking forefathers had called
it the Vale of the Borg or Castle, for that
Castle Hill in Borrodale must surely have
seemed to them a giant's hold, the fittest
place for some high fortress-camp, as it had
seemed to the Romans of an older day.
</p>

<p>
If the first height one had ascended was
rightly called 'Mons Beata,' and the seat one
had last left was placed on a hill that might
be called Mons Blencathrae, which gave such
fair prospect of Blencathra, surely this fair
mount might be called 'Mons Borgadalis,' or
the Mount of Borrodale.
</p>

<p>
I heard a whistle, and to my answering
hulloa came a shout.  The forester was
waiting for me away up there on the highest
point of the woodland, not far from the main
road and above the Brandelhow mines.
Descending swiftly and making my way through
the frosty undergrowth, with rabbits scuttling
here and there and a soft-winged owl lazily
fluttering from a bough above my head, I
was suddenly aware by the scent that hung
upon the fern that a fox had passed that
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P215"></a>215}</span>
way.  But it must have been in the early
morning or 'Brer Rabbit' would not have been
about and the jay would have been screaming,
and, making the best of my way up to
the forester, we soon forgot all about bird
and beast in our honest efforts to let in light
and give fair outlook to the wanderers who
should hither come for rest and thought in
succeeding summers.
</p>

<p>
It is not an easy matter to open up a
woodland view&mdash;the branch of every tree
must be questioned, the joy of 'part seen,
imagined part' must be had in mind,&mdash;but
the work was done at last.  We sat down
for rest on the woodland seat on the fourth
rocky eminence on Brandelhow.  It is a seat
within only a few yards of the high road, yet
so screened from it that it is hardly seen;
but it is a hill with so fair a prospect that
indeed I think angels might pass the little
wicket in the wall and visit those who rest
here unawares.  There is no better name
imaginable for this high resting-place than
'Mons Angelorum.'  As I thought thus the
great sun rolled beyond the hills and all the
vale lay darkened.  Cat Bels and Brandelhow
went black and grey, while still across the
lake Walla and Blencathra lay in full
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P216"></a>216}</span>
sunshine; but at that moment, unthought of
before, there rose a band of angels all along
the riverside, and tiny cloudlets swam up into
shadow, and again from shadow into sun.
The Mount of the Angels was this height
rightly called.
</p>

<p>
'It is likely getting late,' said the forester,
'and if you do not start soon you'll happen
hardly get through the ice to-night.'
</p>

<p>
Down to the boat landing in Victoria Bay
I went, and as I went the woodland filled
with a mysterious light.  I thought of
St. Francis and the visions he had seen at Al
Verna; the sun was beyond the hills, it had
faded now even from Walla Crag, but the
light from Brandelhow seemed to leap up
from the ground, the larches so dim and dead
before gleamed into gold; the red bracken
at my feet burned like fire; it was an
enchanted woodland; the magic after-glow was
the enchanter.

MONS BEATA, BRANDELHOW.
</p>

<p>
I pushed off from the shore, gained the
ice-pack, crashed through it but not without
difficulty, and won the dark, clear water
beyond.  The sun had sunk between Robinson
and Grisedale, a dark cloud-bar had filled the
heavenly interspace, but there in the gap it
seemed as if beneath its heavy eyebrow the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P217"></a>217}</span>
eye of God was keeping watch and ward
above the quiet land.  One had often seen
at the seaside the sun sink and the slender
pillar of golden light reach downward to the
shore, but never had I seen such a magnificent
golden roadway laid upon shining water
for happy dreams of tired men to follow the
flying day, as I saw that eventide upon the
silver ice and the darkling flood of tranquil
Derwentwater.

<h3>
WORDSWORTH AT COCKERMOUTH.
</h3>

<p>
It was a difference that arose on the American
question, between Sir James Lowther and
his law agent and steward, a certain John
Robinson, in the year 1766, that was the
prime cause of the fact that Wordsworth,
the poet, was born here.  For John
Robinson resigned his stewardship, and young
John Wordsworth, then only 24 years of
age, 'a man of great force of character and
real human capacity,' was appointed in his
place to be 'law agent and steward of the
manor of Ennerdale.'  To that post, which
he occupied for the next 18 years, the young
man came from the Penrith neighbourhood,
bringing with him as his girl wife a certain
Ann Cookson, a mercer's daughter, who could
boast, through her descent on her mother's
side from the Crackanthorpes, of Newbiggin
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P219"></a>219}</span>
Hall, an ancestry that flowed from as far
back as the time of Edward III.  She was
thus well suited to marry the son of the
land agent of Sockbridge, near Penistone,
who traced his descent through a long
unbroken line of sturdy Yorkshire yeomen
away in the Penistone neighbourhood, as far
as to the time of the Norman Conqueror.
They took up their abode in the substantial
house now occupied by Mr. Robinson Mitchell,
then lately builded by one Sheriff
Luckock.  It bears date 1745-46, and is
to-day unmarred and unmodernised, remaining
much as it was when John Wordsworth
became its tenant.  We know little of this
young John Wordsworth, but he must have
been a man 'tender and deep in his excess
of love,' for when, after twelve years of
happy married life here in the old manor
house beside the Derwent, his wife died
from consumption, caught, as we are told,
by being put into a damp bed in the 'best
room' when on a visit to friends in London,
he never seemed to recover his spirits, and
he himself died six years after her, in the
year 1783, on the 30th December, and lies
buried at the east end of the All Saints'
Church.  He lost his way on the fells when
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P220"></a>220}</span>
returning from some business engagement
at Broughton-in-Furness, and was obliged
to stay out all night; the chill from exposure
brought on inflammation of the lungs, and
his strength, sapped by deep domestic sorrow,
could not bear up against it.  The orphans
whom he left, Richard, William, Dorothy,
John, and Christopher, four of whom were
remarkable in after life, were then removed
to the care of their uncle Cookson at
Penrith, and Cockermouth knew them no more.
We have been allowed, from William Wordsworth's
autobiographical notes and his poems,
to glean something of those early days.  The
poet tells us:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early died<br>
  My honoured mother, she who was the heart<br>
  And hinge of all our learnings and our loves,<br>
  Nor would I praise her, but in perfect love!<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
We can in fancy see her in earnest converse
with Mr. Ellbanks, the teacher of the school
by the churchyard, talking about William's
'moody and stiff temper'; we can hear her
say 'that the only one of the children about
whom she has fears is William; and he will
be remarkable for good or evil.'  We may
note her pinning on the child's breast the
Easter nosegay, for the young lad is to go
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P221"></a>221}</span>
up to the church, to say his catechism.
Daffodils I expect the flowers were: years
after, in the ecclesiastical sonnets Words
worth, speaking of this act of his mother's,
writes:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Sweet flowers at whose inaudible command<br>
  Her countenance phantom-like doth reappear.<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Or we can see the father, book in hand,
hearing the lad recite the long passages of
Shakespeare, and Milton, and Spenser which
were insensibly to mould his ear to music,
fire his imagination, and make a poet of him.
</p>

<p>
But when I think of Wordsworth in those
childish days I do not go off to the ancient
school by the church to hear him stumble
through Latin verbs.  He was not as happy
there as he was at Mrs. Birkett's, the dame's
school at Penrith; there was no Mary
Hutchinson to keep him company; and he
learned, he tells us, when he went to
Hawkshead at the age of ten, more Latin in a
fortnight than he had learned the two
previous years at Cockermouth.  No, rather
when I want to see the little William
Wordsworth at his happiest, I go with him
into the old Manor House Terrace garden
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P222"></a>222}</span>
by the Derwent's side, and see him with
his sister, that sister 'Emmeline,' as he called
her, chasing the butterfly, or hand in hand
peering through the rose and privet hedge
at the sparrow's nest, 'wishing yet fearing
to be near it.'
</p>

<p>
Or, follow him with his nurse, he a child
of only five years of age, bathing and
basking alternate, all the hot August day in the
shallows of the mill pool, and leaping naked
as an Indian through the tall garden ragwort
on the sands, and clapping his hands to see
the rainbow spring from middle air.  Or I
go with him by the river, 'winding among
its grassy holmes,' whose voice flowed along
his earliest dreams&mdash;that Derwent he could
never forget&mdash;away to the Castle-hold of the
barons of old time, Waldeof, Umfraville,
Multon, Lucies, and Nevilles, and watch
him peering with look of awe into the
dark cellar and dungeons, watch him chase
the butterfly through the grim courts or
climb after the tufts of golden wallflower
upon its broken battlements.
</p>

<p>
But happiest of all was he when with his
story book he lay full stretched, as he
describes in the <i>Prelude</i>, upon the sun-warmed
stones and sandy banks 'beside the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P223"></a>223}</span>
bright blue river,' and there feasted his little
heart on fairy tale and filled his soul with
scenes from wonderland.
</p>

<p>
Wordsworth was never unmindful of the
home of his birth.  He left Cockermouth for
schooldays at Hawkshead when he was a
boy of nine, and though in the holidays, for
the next five years, he paid an occasional
visit to the place, his chief vacation
associations were with Penrith.  The Poet's
connection with this town ceased at his father's
death in 1784, when he was a lad of fourteen;
but he never forgot it.  From nature and
her overflowing soul here in his childhood
days he had received so much that all his
thoughts were steeped in a feeling of grateful
remembrance of it.  He visited the home
of his childhood occasionally to refresh his
heart with a cup of remembrance, and we
find a note of a certain visit in Dorothy's
letter to Mrs. Marshall.  Writing in
September, 1807, she says:&mdash;'W. and M. have
just returned.  They were at Cockermouth,
our native place you know, and the Terrace
Walk&mdash;that you have heard me speak of
many a time&mdash;with the privet hedge, is still
full of roses as it was thirty years ago.  Yes,
I remember it for more than thirty years.'
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P224"></a>224}</span>
</p>

<p>
In 1836 he interests himself in a scheme
for building a new church.  He writes to his
friend Poole, of Nether Stowey, for
assistance to this object.  He tells him that
Cockermouth is in a state of much spiritual
destitution, nearly 6000 souls and only 300
sittings for the poor.  Wordsworth cared
for the poor.  'I have been the means,' he
says, 'of setting on foot the project of
erecting a new church there, and the inhabitants
look to me for much more assistance than I
can possibly afford them, through any
influence that I possess.'
</p>

<p>
As a Keswick parson, I gather with pride
further on in that letter, that it was the
fact of the new church of St. John's having
been built there that spurred him on; and
that he hopes Cockermouth will do as Keswick
has done, and thus excite other towns
to follow so good an example.
</p>

<p>
It is interesting to note that the
Cockermouthians of that day were not of one mind
in the matter, or the Poet had been misled
as to native church feeling; for the inhabitants
having a windfall of £2000 given them
by the Lord of Egremont that year, to spend
as they pleased, preferred a new market
place to a new church, and the old Poet
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P225"></a>225}</span>
writes:&mdash;'This was wanted, so we cannot
complain.'
</p>

<p>
But Wordsworth was disappointed and
grieved too at the spirit of unkindness shown
by some of the people of his native town to his
good Lord Lonsdale.  I have had access to a
MS. letter of Wordsworth's, which shows
that the Church-building project fell through,
as far as he was concerned, by reason of
what he considered the unfair treatment of
an offer of help, made by the then Lord
Lonsdale to the town, in connection with
the church accommodation needed.
</p>

<p>
So far as I know this was the last public
work he attempted to do for the place that
gave him birth.  But at least we cannot
regret that his last effort was in a cause
near to his heart, the cause of the religious
interests and life of his fellow Cumbrians,
the cause of reverence, worship, and godly
fear, of 'pure religion breathing household
laws,' the cause of the worship and praise
of Almighty God, here in his native place.
</p>

<p>
The seed he sowed, though it lay dormant,
did not fall on barren ground; and
in a real sense the present All Saints'
Parish Church may stand as a monument
to the immortal Poet, who then, as ever,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P226"></a>226}</span>
championed 'in perilous times the cause of
the poor and simple,' and did what he might
in his day for church life and piety in the
place of his nativity, Cockermouth.

<h3>
MOUNTAIN SILENCE AND VALLEY SONG.
</h3>

<p class="t3">
  Once more the Heavenly power makes all things new.<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
This was the line from Tennyson's poem
that kept ringing in my ears, as on the
mid-most day of April I wandered out and away
across the vale to the skirts of Skiddaw.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Opens a door in Heaven;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From skies of glass<br>
  A Jacob's ladder falls<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On greening grass,<br>
  And o'er the mountain walls<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young angels pass.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Before them fleets the shower<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And burst the buds,<br>
  And shine the level lands,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And flash the floods,<br>
  The stars are from their hands<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flung thro' the woods.<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
No, no! this last couplet was untrue; the
anemones had not yet opened their delicate
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P228"></a>228}</span>
shells, and the blackthorn buds were only
dimmest seed-pearls of yellowish lustre.
But as I gazed from the fence halfway up
Latrigg and watched the Greta flashing, and
the great plain fresh-enamelled with the
first faint green of spring, a Jacob's ladder
was let down from above Scafell and
Glaramara, and all the angels that ever
came on earth to fill men's hearts with
April jollity came trooping downwards.
They took on various forms.  Some of them
became tortoise-shell butterflies that lay in
sunny content upon the moist woodland path.
Others sailed out of blue air and became
glorious peacock butterflies upon whose
underwings in blue and black one clearly
saw the head and face of human kind
sketched in with lustrous powdery pencillings.
Other angels ministered to the pink coral
glumes of the sycamore; others, again,
daintily untwisted the leafage of the wild
rose in the hedge; others delighted to
unfold the tufts upon the elder.  But the
angels that seemed to be busiest were those
that made the vivid emerald of the 'dog's
mercury' contrast with the faded red of the
bracken in the woods, and where the purple
birches showed against the flowering larches
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P229"></a>229}</span>
added moment by moment a deeper, ruddier
purple to the trees' beauty and a finer flash
of green to the surrounding wood to set the
purple off.
</p>

<p>
But all the gifts of the angels of that
April morning seemed as nothing when
compared with the joy of the sight of one
single angel of the spring&mdash;he a lustrous-backed
swallow who flashed from steel-purple
into black and from black to steel-purple,
and disappeared from sight behind
the larches.  I had known of his coming,
for a swift-eyed shepherd had seen one of
his kind in the valley as early as April 1,
but April 13 to the 15th was marked in my
calendar as swallowtide, and I had not
expected sight of him till this week.  Here
he was, glossy with African sun, and full of
silent message that summer was sure.  The
chiffchaff would be a-trill and the cuckoo
would be calling for a mate within the week.
Ah, swallow! swallow! flying north!  How
much of hope and happiness you bring.
Then as I moved through the larchen grove,
I heard the titmice whispering that they
too were glad, they too felt reassured by
sight of the swallow, and one walked on in
a kind of consciousness that man and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P230"></a>230}</span>
swallow and budding larches were more
akin than one had believed, until the
joyousness of spring found the selfsame echo in
such divers hearts, and that indeed the
over-soul was one, the music and the melody one
voice.  Yes, Wordsworth sang truly when
he wrote:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  One impulse from a vernal wood<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May teach us more of man,<br>
  Of moral evil and of good,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than all the sages can.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
I met a child halfway up Latrigg braiding
her hat with larch flower.  Truly no rubies
ever seemed so rich and rare as these which
the simple village child had twisted in her
hat; her sister had a handful of primroses
she was taking to her father in the
neighbouring cottage, for he was but slowly
recovering from pneumonia, and the child
knew by instinct that a breath from a
primrose posy would do more for him than
all the 'doctors' bottles' in the world.
</p>

<p>
'You have been up Skiddaw betimes,' I said.
</p>

<p>
'Ay, ay, sir; you see they've gone to
"laate" Herdwicks to-day for lambing-time,
and I went up to the Gale with the dogs.'
</p>

<p>
Herdwicks!  Lambing!  What did it all
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P231"></a>231}</span>
mean?  Only that those great brown slopes
of Skiddaw which till this day have been
vocal with flocks and alive with sheep, will
by this eventide be as silent as the grave.
For between April 10 and April 20 the
shepherds know that the Herdwicks will
become mothers of their springtide young,
and so they will go forth to the fells and
upland pastures, to bring their woolly charges
down from the mountain heights to the
safety and the food and care of the
dale-farm enclosures.  I overtook the shepherds
at the 'Gale,' and went with them.  Soon
the dogs were seen scouring the fell-side,
now disappearing from sight, now coming
back to get a signal from their master.  A
wave of the hand to left or right was all
that was needed, and away they went, and
slowly and surely they seemed to be able
to search out and bring into a close
company the Herdwicks from all the heathery
waste and grey-bleached mountain hollows.
</p>

<p>
Then began the home-bringing.  Very
tenderly and gently did the dogs urge the
sheep, heavy with young, down the fell-side
slopes.  Now and again the shepherd
cried, 'Hey, Jack!' and away the collies
flew back towards him.  'Ga away by!'
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P232"></a>232}</span>
and away again the collies flew in a
great circle out beyond and behind the
sheep.  The sheep were a little hustled
and came on too fast.  Then the shepherd
whistled and held up his hand, and the dogs
sat like stones till he whistled and waved
his hand again.  So down from Lonscale
and across the gulfy Whitbeck the sheep
came.  The dogs dashed off to where,
through a great carpet of ever-lucent moss,
the main fountains break from the hill.
They slaked their thirst, then came back
slowly to urge the flocks homeward and
downward toward the Shepherd's Cross,
and so over the Gale to the Lonscale
Farm.  We stopped at the Cross, and a
tall, 'leish,' handsome man, with fair hair
and the grey Viking eye, said in solemn
undertone, 'Fadder and brudder cud hev
been weal content to be wid us on sic a
day as this, I'se thinking.'  And the mist
gathered in his eyes, and he said no more,
but just went homeward with the sheep.
Ah, yes, that Shepherd's Cross tells of
men&mdash;father and son&mdash;who spent their whole
lives in following the Herdwicks on the
sides of Skiddaw and Lonscale Fell; wrought
for their sheep, thought of them by day
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P233"></a>233}</span>
and dreamed of them by night, and were as
proud, as ever David was, of what they
looked upon as the finest life a man need
care to live, the mountain shepherd's round
of love and toil.
</p>

<p>
I waved adieu, and up beyond the huts
to 'Jenkin' I went.  The red fern had been
washed into faintest ochre, the heather had
grown grey with winter storm, but everywhere
beneath the blanched grass one felt
new life and tenderest first flush of April
green was astir; and as one looked down
from 'Jenkin' into the circle of the deep
blue hills and the Derwent's perfect mirror,
one saw that though the larches were still
brown there was an undertone of something,
neither brown nor green, that flooded not
only the larch woods but the great Latrigg
pastures also, and betokened that the spring
was even at their doors, and that the fells
would soon rejoice with the emerald valley
below.  Gazing at the vale of Crosthwaite,
where still all the trees seem winter white,
one was astonished at the darkness of the
hedgerows that divided the meadows, and
one saw the new fallows shine and swim
like purple enamel upon the green flood of
the springtide grass.  'Jenkin' was reached,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P234"></a>234}</span>
but not until many swathes of lingering
snow, black with the smoke of the blast
furnaces of the coast and of Lancashire and
Yorkshire mills, had been passed.  Here at
'Jenkin top' we found two men hard at
work 'graaving' peats for the Coronation
bonfires on June 26.
</p>

<p>
'Well, how goes the peat-graving?' said I,
and a ruddy-faced Norseman from a Threlkeld
farm said, 'Aw, gaily weel, sir; but
I'm thinking we mud hev nae mair kings
upo' the throane, for this job will finish t'
peat moss, and peats are hard to finnd
within reach o' Skiddaw top.  You see,'
said he, 'it's lost its wire, and peat widout
wire in it is nae use for makking a "low"
wid.'
</p>

<p>
I saw that what he called 'wire' were the
rootlets of the ancient undergrowth of years
gone by, the matted texture of primeval
springtides, and, stooping down, he broke a
peat across and showed me the wire.  'You
kna,' he continued, 'we shall just leave peats
ligging here, and thoo mun send up scheul-lads
to spreead them in a forthnet's time.
Then they mud coom oop a week laater
and shift 'em and turn them, and then a
week laater they mud coom and foot 'em.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P235"></a>235}</span>
That is if thoo want 'em in fettle by Coronation-daay,
for they are ter'ble watter-sick noo.'
</p>

<p>
'Foot them?' I said.  'What do you
mean?'  And the shepherd took a couple
and leaned them one against another, and
showed me how thus a draught of air passed
between the peats and ensured their drying.
'Well, good-daay, good-daay.  But we mud
hev nae mair kings to be crooned,' said he;
'for peat moss ull nobbut howd oot for this
un, I'm thinking.'
</p>

<p>
I bade farewell, and down to the valley
I went, noting how doubly near and blue
the hills and vales all seemed to grow, as
one passed down beneath the veils of haze
which had lent both greyness and distance
to the view.  Again I saw the swallow skim;
again I watched the gorgeous butterflies,
and, with a wand of palm-flower that had
just lost its gold, and the rosy plumelets of
the larch in my hand, I made the best of my
way homeward, through air that throbbed
and thrilled with the voice of thrush and
blackbird, and felt the deep contrast between
these silent flockless slopes of Skiddaw, and
the ringing singing valley at his feet.
